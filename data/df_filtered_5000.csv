"nothing wrong with it except...: i got this and the first thing i noticed is that the usb interface was bent, like if someone did it with pliers. i fixed it with a butter knife, but i didn't like the fact that i had to do this..",0,47
don't bother: i read the first few chapters and didn't care for this book at all. the wording was not something i cared for. i took a chance for $.99!,0,30
"speed loader???: i never use this ""speed loader"" because i find it speedier to load by hand. probably good in a gun fight but for the range, i will use my hands.",0,32
"awful: almost pointless video. the majority of the time they discuss investing down in the keys or florida, this video was obviously made during the real estate boom in florida, i can now see why florida is in so much trouble. anytime you have ""real estate investors"" like these people you're bound to create problems. no information on multi family.",0,60

"i do not open, but this is why it gets a one star review...: hello?! amazon? what is going on? how old, what weight/height should my child be prior to using the seat? or when should my child not be allowed on it!? when it breaks and somehow harms my child? have these been recalled?until further information is posted; amazon, i am shaking my head in disgust and surprise...",0,69
"few words to describe how bad...: i have never written a review for a book before and have read a few hundred books over the last few years. this by far is the worst novels ever put in print and deserves to be outed. i am not even sure that the publisher should not be punished for allowing this to go to market. there is no real story and jason plays almost no part in this book. it is almost as if the writer took out a thesaurus and scrambled the most complicated words and ""created"" a book. i could not even begin to explain any portion of the several senseless ramblings of stories that make up this book.",0,119
"disgusting: this book is digusting. one of the reviewers says ""this is what makes gay men gay"". ay mi dios! it's more like ""this is why society hates us"". two men with no restraint or reserve, who will do anybody anywhere. the weirder or kinkier the better. out in public, no concern for their hiv+ status.it is scary to think that some gay men operate this way. i could barely finish the book did but and will now throw in the trash as i don't want anyone else to read this.",0,91
"expired after 3 months: i had the same experience as the previous 1 star user. this was a replacement for the identical product which lasted 7 years. this unit lasted 3 months (it beeped once occasionally even though the test was fine). we replaced the battery, blew compressed air into the unit as is recommended in troubleshooting guides, to no avail. unfortunately we no longer have the box to return it since it has a 5 year warranty.",0,78
"grave disappointment of cruz smith: i am more than an avid fan of mr. martin cruz smith. i own a complete collection of his works. either i read the book hype wrong or else i have mis-judged mr. cruz smith's ability as a writer. except for the excerpts by established time honored writers: mark twain, sir arthur conan doyle, guy de maupassant, i find the book mundane, deplorable and a disappointment that mr. cruz smith attached his name to it. i found bad usage of grammar, stories that lost the development of the plot, confusion of character identification (frederick ?)and just poor mystery writing overall.amaturism personified. mr. cruz smith, did you read the book before you affixed your name to it? i will gladly sell it if i thought i could recoup my costs. this shakes my confidence in mr. cruz smiths future writings and whether or not i may purchase them.",0,152
"a real stupid book: one of the most boring and stupid books i`ve read in a long time. full of ignorant remarks. from mr clancys observation that asian girls like westerners because they are better ""equipped"" than the asian males, via people saying comrade doctor etc to each other in russia, ten years after the soviet unions fall, to the ""fact"" that american girls are slimmer and healthier than the rest of the world(when we know that they are sicker due to overweight than the rest of the world). well, a writer can write about his white supremacy but when he writes as boring as tom clancy does in this book it gets completely uninteresting. just pure typewriting and after 350 pages i had to give up.  yes, and i spell terrible...",0,133
"horrible: this cd let me down so much. i havent really like staind since break the cycle but i thought disfunction and tormented were amazing so i always give them a chance. i figured maybe staind had gone back to the more heavier songs but nope. it also seems like a lot of the songs on here sound alike. if you ask me do not buy this cd, total waste of money.",0,72
"disappointing: have been looking forward to this cd for 14 months! it was august of last year when ludacris was talking about chicken and beer from the stage during anger management tour. well, then it was supposed to come out and they kept pushing it back...until now! guess he kept trying to improve it and finally gave up. this ain't nearly as good as his others. weak beats, weak raps, weak overall energy wise. stand up is the catchiest outta 17 tracks and it ain't that great. the song with snoop is just dreadful. why would snoop let himself get hooked up w/that track?",0,104
wack: a damn shame!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! a fake odb of the wu tang clan. i highly doubt the a&r still works for the label. this could cd have only sold 2 copies :to him and his mama!!!!!!!!!!!,0,35
"this is not how a great intellectual mind should be remembered: robert fomon was my grandfather, i dont understand this mans bias against a man he didnt know. my grandfather died when i was in 3rd grade, and this is not how i hoped he would be remembered. despite the mishappenings dealing with ef hutton, i would appreciate all those to refrain from posting rude messages on the morals of my grandfather, for the same reason i would not critisize a family member of yours who i knew nothing about.",0,90
"scientific?: paula begoun has built up an amazing business and marketing machine based on very little actual scientific fact and mostly biased opinion. if you've ever seen this woman give an interview ... well, let's just say her poor complexion and 80's makeup job speaks for itself. this is like the portly dr. phil writing a diet book and everyone flocking to read it.you've got to give the woman credit though. she's taken her opinion, common sense and sketchy science background and turned it into a very lucrative business.",0,89
don't waste your time: i'm only 1/3 through but this is one of the most boring books i've ever read. i'm forcing myself to read it only because of the money i spent to buy it.,0,36
"headsets fall apart: the sound was awesome - no question about it - but the headphones fell apart after 8 months. the cheap plastic used to connect the ear pieces to the head piece cracked and eventually broke, and now a sharp piece of metal sticks into my head if i ever wear them. i needed to tape them with hockey tape to hold them together.....i expect better for $300![look in the product images for pictures of where they broke]",0,80
"take a nap: the first 10 minutes of this movie were rather amusing and after that it settled down to a real napper. endless long face shots of schimmer in particular looking concerned,pathetic,etc.,etc.made the film a test of one's staying power. occasional humor and the interest generated by paltrow and hersey helped,but the movie was unsavable.a 25 year old with his weird mother and bunk beds,paltrow's pathetic outfits and hersey,s atrocious hair and truly strange behavior are just a few of the blots on this would-be landscape. michael rappaport and that bitsy character trying to go over the top was also borderline offensive.as i review the film in my mind, two stars might have been too high! skip this one and enjoy an extra episode of friends.",0,127
don't buy: this item came in a sealed bag but when opened it was greasy like it had already been used and it was dented. don't waste your time and money on this inferior product.,0,35

"save yourself from undoubted fits of nacrolepsy.: it seems like palahniuk is stuck in a lyrical rut that comes out more and more recycled with each novel, and although this was fine through the first five novels (with the exception of invisible monsters-which is probably slightly worse than diary) it really bottoms out here.insert comically dark one-liner here.reinterate said one-liner every fourth paragraph.if anything, stick with survivor, choke, or fight club.",0,71

"poor reception, poor battery life: even when y ou dont use the unit, the battery drains itself rapidly. reception is poor overall. i even tried the antenna headphones. i gave up, cancelled my subscription. if anyone interested send an email, will sell for half the going price.",0,47

"not star wars: this game represents the beginning of the end of the star wars franchise. it's not made by lucasarts and doesn't really have much to do with star wars at all.the game was not ready when i was beta testing it one month ago and i highly doubt that any of the critical bugs are fixed yet. this is a ""serious"" game which requires alot of repetitive work and a huge time investment.unless you are a student with nothing better to do all summer, don't buy this game. you need to invest at least 4 hours a day to be successful in the game.on the positive side, the combat system is alot of fun. going on a hunting expedition with a bunch of other players is cool. but the tedious portions of the game far outweigh the fun factor of combat.",0,143
"anticlimactic: this novel started off just fine. i was quite interested in the story and quite anxious to follow it along.the characters were interesting; the plot was quite entertaining and suspenseful. in his usual style, dean koontz kept me wondering about what was going to happen.however, the ending was so disappointing. i felt robbed of my time and energy. maybe i have been spoiled by reading his more recent works first, but the ending left me staring at the page.definitely not one of koontz's better novels. he does have many more satisfying works.",0,93
"poor cole: while the others in the cole series are excellent reads, this one isn't even so-so. run of the mill, boring political statement. hard to believe it was written by the same man.",0,34
"almost worst jerky i've ever had!: this stuff is terrible! it's not hot & spicy in any way, unless you can count the coating of chili powder all over it & the bag. the jerky itself has no flavor at all. i repeatedly tried it over and over, hoping it was just a bad piece/batch/bag, but it was all the same - terrible, terrible flavor. if you think this will be anything like jack link's peppered jerky, or any peppered/hot jerky for that matter, you're going to be very disappointed.",0,90
"zane wannabee: the book starts off strong and finishes weak. it reminded me a lot of addicted by zane, but this author lacks the descriptions and feeling that should have been in the book. the book also is not very believable in certain parts and is going way too fast.",0,50
"what a letdown. . . !: i started this book with fervor and hunger and ended with a ""toss out the window"" of the book and a vow to find a new author to follow. in his haste to complete this book john grisham forgot that readers are not dummies and that we expect the author to be true to his characters and his audience. after reading this book, i've taken a long pause from grisham. . .",0,78
"even twilight has more bite than this: vampire boys has plenty of boys, but you would never guess that they are vampires. this movie is pretty dull stuff. even twilight was better. and the actor who played caleb was horrible. a lot of the dialogue was stilted, and there is very little action. i think the movie would have been more successful had it been called ""pretty boys"" instead. that's the point of this movie anyway. the point surely wasn't to entertain or to scare people. the only reason i'm giving this two stars instead of one is because there isn't an ugly person in the cast. that counts for something, right?",0,112
"nextar mp3 player: i am not pleased with this product. the manual says it is supposed to load mp3, wmp, etc. formats - but it doesn't!it only does mp3. i called the 800 number tech support line and was told by a recording that they were busy and someone would return my call within 48 hours - never happened!i do not recommend this product!",0,64
"could've been better.: like the songs from linkin park and goo goo dolls. thought the other songs could've been better - a lot better. especially the transformes theme song. i do not like this version at all. the version by lion on the original animated movie is much better.also much better, and a more recent version, is a version of the song done by black lab. this should've been on the album and would've been good for the closing credits of the movie as well. [...] and you can hear their version (and see some youtube videos of the song).i, too, hope an orchestral soundtrack of the movie comes out.",0,110
"sorely disappointed: i love fiction and nonfiction books about queen elizabeth, mary queen of scots, and their century. but this was a real disappointment. it didn't offer any new understanding of the time period or of elizabeth or anne's characters. the love scenes were awkward and embarrasing. they seemed gratuitous and out of place. thank goodness there are other good books about this period out there. check out alison weir, reay tannahill or patricia finney for good books set in 16th century england.",0,83
"blah, blah, blah: spoiler alert - if you saw ""full impact"" you know how this one ends, unfortunately the acting and special affects are not as good. not even close.",0,30
"sorry, not much here for me: i bought it for some insight on troubleshooting my ps2, disk read problems. not much there, unfortunately. that in it's own self wouldn't be a killer, but the fact that the book is 2/3 ""guide to games"" cinches the deal. it's from 2001, so there are no games since then included in the guide. if you just bought a ps2 (like i did) and you find this for a buck at a flea market, it might be worth it.",0,85
"type is not clear: this is a very frustrating work for a beginner to try to use. it is very difficult to distinguish between a lower case ""c"" and an ""e"" as well as an ""l"" and an ""i"".",0,39
"sub-titles: unless you like to read during a movie, don't but this one. it is almost like a foreign film there are so many sub-titles to read - so much is in a foreign language instead of just english. i spent so much time reading what they were saying that i didn't get to watch much of the visual.",0,59
"only 1/2 a cord?: does this include the portion that connects to the fryer itself? that is the part i need, i have the portion that goes into the wall and the picture only shows the portion i have. anybody know?",0,41

faialure in product: screen quickly became fogged. weight would keep changing meaning you guess at what this fish weighed. last fish on the scale was a drum and the chain pulled out of the bottom of the scale. not for me.,0,41
"why buy when you can read for free?: google the table of contents, and you'll find virtually every story in this dreadful amalgamation of sequential non-sequitors somewhere online. then again, don't and save yourself the eyestrain and nausea. spare yourself the horror of first lines that not even the bulwer-lytton contest judges could stomach. avoid the incomprehensible syntax, the superfluous verbiage, the repetitive and redundent tautologies that constitute the endless and pointless drivel that is this book. if someone gives it to you as a present, sever all contact with that person, regardless of the closeness of your former relationship, for your presenter obviously wishes you ill.",0,107
"magazine full of ads: maxim used to be one of the greatest magazine ever. now its just full of ads. hardly worth the price, even at 5 dollars a year. every other page is an advestisment. very disappointed.",0,38
"a few select ann coulter quotes: here are some of my favorite ann coulter quotes that only proves the point that she knows nothing about politics and is a hack job just to make conservatives feel better about their views.""liberals hate america""""liberals hate all religion except islam""""democrats actually hate working class people""""liberals hate society""""even islamic terrorists don't hate america like liberals do""democrats will destroy anyone who stands in their way. all that matters to them is power""""liberals can't just come out and say they want to take more of our money, kill babies, and discriminate on the basis of race""""liberals seek to destroy sexual differentiation in order to destroy morality""""that's the whole point of being a liberal: to feel superior to people with less money""""liberals are crazy""don't expect any of these quotes to make any sense at all. they were all written by ann coulter.",0,145
"good luck trying to have your ryobi product serviced: i purchased the ryobi lawn eddger for my ryobi trimmer. on my second use, the lawn edger became stuck to the trimmer body.i tried 4 different local ""authorized ryobi"" service centers. none will accept a ryobi trimmer in for ""warranty repair"". for the past 2 weeks, the only message i have been able to get on the ""ryobi 1-800 number"" has been ""due to heavy call volume... we request that you call back later"". even the ryobi web page is most of the time out of service or extremely slow.i would never consider buying any ryobi (or products from the same family).",0,111
".: while i thought this was something of a filler novel, it was still fun for those who appreciate a space twist.",0,22
"overrated: i love other nicolas sparks movies like the notebook, dear john, but for some reason this one didn't do it for me. wanted to see it in the theater even, but glad i waited for home rental.",0,38
no better than $1 earbuds: i didn't expect sound perfection but thought i would get a set of earbuds that we're durable - wrong! sound is okay but the sound connection keeps going in and out. i will not buy another pair of these crappy buds.,0,46
"i saw the wrong movie: i thought this film was going to be herbie the love bug. to my suprise i was watching a zombie flick, so i'll go ahead and review. i had just picked up morty from the nursing home and wheeled him in to see herbie. you see we fist made out to the original herbie movie and thought we could recapture some of that zing. we must have gone into the wrong theater but it was too late to wheel morty out once the film started so we wouldn't bother everyone...i shouldn't have taken morty to see it, at one part he screamed so hard his falsies flew out and smacked a young man's head in the seat in front of him. morty also dropped his sippy cup he got so scared.",0,136
"still waiting for a response: it's very difficult to push the strings in order to play a song, you have to push it very hard !!!i sent an email to the company 3 weeks ago and i am still waiting for a response....bottom line, i really don't like the guitar...",0,50
fps action: this is based on the james bond movie. i tried out the game and it seems to demand a lot of button-mashing. it looks like the graphics are good.,0,31
"over-produced bollywood: this movie was well produced and has a beautiful, semi-fantastical setting (almost more like a village in france than india). the acting and cinematography were both very interesting, with some beautiful shots. however, it lacked the light-hearted comedy and story that attracts independent american viewers. my wife and i love seeing indian movies about the conflicts between traditional indian society and modernity. in these movies, the family is both part of the plot and oftentimes comic relief. however, i didn't laugh once during this film. it's a serious love story, but mixed with the dancing and fairy tale setting, it's hard to take seriously.a related problem is that this movie simply had too much singing and dancing. i know bollywood movies tend to have a lot of singing and dancing, but at times this movie seemed to have more music video scenes than plot. i ended up fast-forwarding these sequences.",0,152
"surrender cinema's getting too tame: although the production values are up to surrender's usual glossy standards, the sex scenes are so stylized (and so unrealistic) that they are totally uninvolving. also, they're simply not as hot as in earlier surrender films like ""femalien"" and ""virtual encounters"", especially the girl-girl scene. in this film, it's more of an exotic dance than anything else.a final note -- the star, shauna o'brien, has unfortunately gone the implant route. her natural body was a knockout (see the original ""friend of the family""), but now she looks preposterous. too bad!",0,95
"good movie for taking a nap: saying that this movie is slow would be an understatement. molasses moves faster. i'm usually a bit leary of films written and directed by the same person and in this case i was right to be. somehow i managed to watch the first 40 minutes without completely falling asleep. after that i started fast forwarding. as one reviewer said, it's an interesting concept done with very poor execution.",0,74
"dreadful: i am a fan of dba & 65dba, in their incarnations after this album. this album has nothing to do with their later electronic dance pop sounds. the only song on this album that resembles that sound is track #2, ""we must go."" this album is blatantly evangelistic in lyrics, and the music is very churchy ensemble music -- even in the realm of ccm, this is bad. avoid this album. if you're looking for dba's electronic dance pop sounds, the 1996 album ""bubble"" is a good choice, and is an album i still enjoy listening to. much later i bought 1994's ""shout"" -- not as good as ""bubble"" but good enough for me as a dba fan.",0,119
"don't bother!!!!: first let me say i know this album well, and it is essential for any fan of ron dante, or the archies. the problem here is that the mastering is so godawful poor! it seems to be mastered from a record-and judging from the nauseating sound of all the side two tracks (6-10), the record used was pressed off-center!!! artwork bears no resemblance to original, and mine came with a booklet but no tray card! add to that the fact that 2 tracks are missing from the original release, and this makes the disc useless. most dante fans already have a copy of the vinyl, and that is a superior copy to own at this point. wait for ron to reissue this himself-he'll do better...",0,127
madonna's voice is simply too weak...: ...for musical singing. it gets on your nevers after some time and you simply have heard better versions of these songs by better singers often before,0,32
"trash.: if you want a usb notebook cooler that's going to last a few weeks with minimal use, go right ahead. the plastic feet came off, the power light is a blue/purple strobe that could compete with local law enforcement, and the dual cords (power/usb) is cumbersome.",0,47
"an okay gift...: i just received this hat in the mail. it's made of sturdy material and was stitched well, but the lines on the hat aren't where they should be. kind of defeats its purpose...",0,36
directors cut horrible: i have always been a major fan of this movie. i got the first dvd a couple of years ago but it was a bit of a hassle to get up in the middle and turn it over. i was excited by the new two disc version in which the entire movie was now on one side. great i thought. then the extra scenes popped in which totally were unnecessary and detracting from the plot. gratuitous nudity and thin scenes that should have been left on the film edit floor. i cant understand what they substatially did for this great movie other than significantly dilute it. i guess i'll go back to my first dvd and just take a popcorn break when i have to get up and chnage sides,0,133
"what is this?: what has rush turned themselves to? this is a horrible cd, only that. there's no point in trying to justify these plastic, incoherent and comercial songs saying ""we're trying new ways"", ""this is our best album so far"", ""we do what gives us pleasure"". one only needs to compare it with ""moving picture"", ""permanent waves"" and a handful of others rush recordings!!",0,65
"christie is a shallow narcissist: after viewing this video, it seems clear that christie brinkley is a self-centerd, shallow, narcissist. no wonder she burned through four poor husbands.",0,28
very boring movie with a swimming pool: this movie was more boring than in the bedroom. don't rent it. don't buy it.,0,22

"fit incorrect compared to other brands of same size: ordered 60x32, these are small compared to other brands of the same size - probably closer to a 56. fat sizes shouldn't be hip-hugger cut - it doesn't even make sense.",0,40
"the book tries to be too difinitive.: the book is a broad and detailed manual covering the entire list of restoration steps and processes, but what the book fails to account for are manufacturing differences created by the various gm assembly plants. an example is that a 65 chevelle model from the kansas city plant will have more undercarriage parts painted than the car assembled at the fremont, california plant. the book tends to state ""the part appears this way and this way only"" on a properly restored car and makes no accounting of mid-year changes or manufacturing location difference. i certainly hope this book is never used to judge concours chevelle restorations.for the restorer wishing to learn great deals of general information about restoring a chevelle, this can be a good reference tool, it just needs to be taken with a grain of salt not not used as the sole source of restoration information.",0,155
"do not buy: this is a waste of money, ripped apart after two workouts on a treadmill. will make you sweat but will break apart after a couple of uses. i purchased the valeo neoprene waist belt instead for the same price and its lasted me 3 weeks, makes me sweat even more and hasn't worn yet.",0,57
"terrible cueing: i have a number of the firms dvds and have been using them for two years with great results. bought this thinking i would step it up a notch but, the cueing is so bad you end up stopping to say what!! the most disconcerting thing is that the steps are off the beat of the music and that drove me crazy. it's a tough workout if you can get in your own groove but i find myself using this the least of all the firms workouts.",0,89
"good god, this sucked.: scott, keep walking, as far away as you can get from ever writing another book. you can't recap, your rants suck, and you get all pissy and whiny whenever anyone has a problem with anything you say or do. this is the worst book i have ever read, in any genre, including chyna's book. rantsylvania - we really do suck.",0,64
the wachowski brothers really drop the ball with this one.: we waited this long for this? a movie that not only does not make a heap of sense but is a major let down in the most profound sense of the word. its seems to me that the wachowski brothers only concentrated on the special effects but forgot about writing a compelling plot to go with it. the mythology that made the first matrix such a classic is thrown out for an incoherent cyber juke of a story that not only insults the legion of fans but makes them look stupid for waiting around for theses sequels.the wachowski brothers should be a shame of themselves for ripping off the fans of the first movie.,0,124
"arrived shattered: arrived broken, i should have listened to the advise given about the shipping. however, in all fairness, amazon was quick to allow me to return, and just as quick as crediting our account.",0,35
"much ado about nothing: after all the fuss about this book i could not wait to get my hands on it. throughout my reading, however, i could not wait for mr. franzen to get to the point. in the end it was an uninteresting tale about a dysfunctional family.",0,49
"ages old and nothing else--not the bbc documentary: i was sorely disappointed upon receiving this product,as i was expecting the 1988 bbc documentary called rock of ages that you can find on youtube......the front cover looked from that era and being reasonably inexpensive,i just assumed that it must be one in the same.all this dvd is,is a collection of videos any def leppard fan has seen a jillion times.bummer",0,69
"total rip off!!!!: i bought the 40 ounce version on ebay with free shipping for $28.00. i was expecting much more for the high price. the kleen kanteen is not insulated at all. if you put something cold in it, expect it to get warm really fast. if you put hot stuff in it (like me), expect it to get cold fast. expect to burn your fingers every time you pick it up. expect to burn your inner lip on hot metal ever time you take a sip. the steel is very thin. i expect that if i dropped it, it would certainly dent.this product is honestly worth about 6-8 dollars. if i bought it from their website for $28 and paid the high shipping cost, i'd be enraged when the product arrived. it's simply way too expensive.",0,138

"2nd ed forgotten realms boxed set-better left in the box: just fyi: this review is for the 2nd edition boxed set, not the d&d3; hardcover.there is much to the old axiom of 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it', and as cliche as it might be, it holds very true to the 2nd edition forgotten realms boxed set. oversized text and space wasting boarder art notwithstanding, the 2nd ed boxed set incorporates all of the nonsense of the 'time of troubles' trilogy of novels. it also adjusts the dale reckoning time line by almost a hundred years for no reason. it gives scant overviews of too large of an area, and almost nothing on the things that really matter, like characters, noble houses, and rivalries between states. it also brings out the worst of the realms, like munchkin characters such as drizzt du'urden and elminster. stick with the grey 1st edition boxed set, it's a much superior version.",0,158
"have not read the book: i will admit upfront that i have not read nor will i read this book. but let me say this about r.c. sproul.he's a smart man with a good deal of natural intelligence but in many ways he has wasted his life by supporting a dying cause - calvinism.the reformed and presbyterian denominations in the u.s. are dying, and indeed are on their deathbed, and all of sproul's intelligence cannot nor will it change the reality of this dying heresy.calvin was wrong from the beginning and sproul was wrong to take his god-given mind and use it to try to prop up calvinism.i will say again, calvin was wrong from the start. the holy spirit is nowhere present in the writings of calvin anymore than he is present in the writings of sproul because the holy spirit is not the spirit of division and untruth.what a terrible waste, but this is what happens when your father in the faith is not jesus christ but john calvin.",0,171

"disappointment: my 3 year old daughter already has an adorable 2.5"" strawberry shortcake set with lots of pieces and lots of room for imaginary play. she loves it, but it only came with one doll. i've searched for the individual 2.5"" dolls but to no avail, so out of exasperation, i bought this set so that ss could have a friend. while the extra dolls were exactly what i was looking for, the rest of the set was a complete disappointment. there are only two pieces in addition to the dolls and their hats, and they are nothing more than kids meals toys. she was so disappointed when none of the pieces came apart for play that she almost cried. i ended up taking the scooter and the cake off the platforms so that she could play with them and threw the rest away.",0,144

"nash bridges - the first season: both discs are damaged, possibly during the actual manufacturing or burning of the discs. there are large swirl-type patterns around the read faces of both discs that will not polish out with a micro fiber cloth. therefore, parts of some of the episodes freeze up, and the discs skip to the next undamaged chapter, which is usually multiple chapters. amazon does not replace these discs and they won't exchange the season for another title, because they are opened. i may try a buffing wheel, but i'm not sure it will help, as the marks don't appear to be scratches, but a defect in the discs themselves. i also bought season 2 and 3 which are not damaged and play without incident.",0,127

don't waste your time!: i don't know what the point of this book was. it took 102 pages to develop the so called 'mystery.' i knew i should have stopped reading but all the reviews had said what a good writer this author was. i stuck with it and now regret doing so. this is a very simple book with a lot of things that need to happen in a cetain way and of course they do. the characters seem to be living in the 1930's even though this takes place in current time. they all are naive people. this is my second book by this author and i will not make the mistake of reading a third book! you shouldn't either.,0,122

"terrible colorization: this version of the movie on vhs is not recommended for collectors. the movie is colorized, apparently by a kindergartener with crayons. blotches of pink and orange for faces and a torch which burns with green, orange, and yellow flames are evidence that the colorizing process was done in a haphazard manner with no concern for the quality of the job. the movie itself is quite good although i personnaly prefer the richard chamberlain version. 2 stars for a really bad print of a good movie.",0,88

"musical kleenex: joss stone's a decent singer, but shouldn't be writing songs; or releasing them. i couldn't find a single memorable tune here. i also thought her singing was too flamboyant, but perhaps it's to keep up with the heavy production, which is so overcooked it's insufferable. next time joss should try losing the rappers and the big beat overkill. as one critic wrote, ""sometimes it takes more balls to go it alone then with a whole crew."" i couldn't agree more. this album is like musical kleenex, use it, then lose it. better luck next time.on the other side of the coin, there's ""the orange album"" by stefy (rae) which is a stunning debut. had gwen stefani made it, journalists would have called it a pop masterpiece. it's new artists like stefy that could keep the music business afloat. are we listening ms. stone.",0,145

"a different nikita: fans of the current ""nikita"" tv series should be warned that this earlier version of the show is much darker and more violent. from the end of season 2 on, it takes a very different direction as nikita gradually becomes a willing member of section 1 (division). also, this show makes frequent use of graphic sadomasochistic themes, and there seems to be at least one torture scene in every episode. in fact, section 1 often behaves more like the gestapo than a rogue branch of the cia. the suggestion here is that this is justified, and there is a strong neoconservative political undercurrent to the show. many of the episodes end in tragedy, and i found this series to be a major turnoff. two much better programs in this genre are ""alias"" and ""mi-5."" i would recommend both of them over this show.",0,146

"one pesky problem in otherwise perfect pyrex: i have an ""older model"" of the 1-quart pyrex measuring cup, so i have a direct comparison. my original is tall and slender, with thick glass. the new version is short, wide and the glass is thinner. i don't know if this makes a difference, but my problem is thus: when pouring liquid, my new measuring cup drips. the spout allows liquid to escape down the outside of the container, often outside my bowl. this is not what i'm looking for when attempting to achieve an exact amount of any ingredient needed in a recipe. however, pyrex is pyrex. great for so many things, and this is a perfect size container for a million different applications ... thus it's impossible for me to give it less than 2 stars. just keep in mind that you may experience the same issues as i'm having around accurate pouring.",0,153

"not very good: as other reviewers have noted, this book is compromised by two serious flaws. one, rats turn out to be an insuffiently engaging subject for a micro-history of this sort. i don't feel like i learned much about them that was particularly interesting or unexpected, and the book feels padded. two, sullivan is a lousy writer. his prose is rambling and disorganized. he makes spelling errors, misuses words, uses tenses in disagreement, and more. was this book even edited, i wondered? i doesn't seem like it. the yarns he spins to pad the book are not very interesting and tend to petter out without going anywhere. he wrote a book about himself writing a book about rats, and it's not a good one.",0,125
"solipsistic foolishness: she croons the album title, ""oops i did it again"" with a fake sincerity. i should say this of the whole album.there is missing a sincerity and intelligence that was definitely audible on her first album. before her lyrics had force and what gave it that was its ambiguity, its unwillingness to tow the line. the old brittany would never have given into corporate pressure or public opinion. so no she did not do it again.she seems to be more selfish than ever with words that refer always to herself. that's usually okay, but she has lost some picture of who she really is. who is the ""i"" in ""i did it again""? clearly it's not the ""me"" in ""baby, hit me one more time.""i was disppointed with this album, though i believe in her. i believe that she can see what she has become and learn that she has lost that wiseful innocence and become privy to something less. though i must admit there were a couple songs that made me cry.",0,175

"ultimate primer on how not to bring a classic to the screen: the fantasticks strength is in the intimate and very theatrical presentation. with a small band and a small house it is at its best. however, when making the move to the screen almost all of what made the fantasticks the longest running musical is lacking. it is unfortunate, for the location and house sets are almost perfect for the show. but the characterizations are skewed and lacking, and changes made for this movie almost always moves it away from the charming stage classic.musical numbers are eliminated, and the shows best known song, try to remember, is included briefly at the end as an afterthought that it had to be represented.there are some things that work here, and if you have not seen the show you may even enjoy it. but don't expect the fantasticks that launched a young jerry orbach on a long career.",0,156

"sick: am i the only one who hated this book? it's a grotesque, rambling and ultimately pointless excursion into the minds of a couple of animal-torturing psychotics. i kept reading only the hope that they would both come to a horrible end, but was disappointed even there. there is no deeper meaning or startling insights here. the characters had absolutely no redeeming features and the ending was contrived and resolved nothing. we don't need to read about people like this, there are enough crazies in the real world. it's the second of banks' books i have read, and will definitely be the last.",0,103

such a waste: ok here we go. the first presenter somewhat skimmed the surface. the second presenter was performing a strait out hypnosis session. i was ticked because i am a professional hypnotist and i recognized it from the start. this was supposed to teach remote viewing not a flat out opportunity to get over on people by hypnotizing them without them knowing it. that was a bunch of b.s. that's why it didn't make sense to one of the reviewers here. the presenter wasn't giving a seminar on remote viewing he was hypnotizing the audience without telling them what a scam artist.,0,103

fiction: fiction folks. this is another fiction by the same writer. kids who have no knowledge of the reality of the pagan beliefs eat this stuff up. as all the other books like this i doubt there is a claim by the writer or publishers that it was meant to be taken literally or even seriously. kids do though so it keeps them busy with make-believe until they grow up and remember these reads so they can become interested in the real thing. just hopefully it won't lead to them becoming interested in the negative things that are often associated with occult matters. sometimes kids can't seperate the differences. that is my only objection to these writings. but for the most part kids are pretty smart today and most know these types of books are nothing more than entertainment. i only am concerned about the ones who are looking to fit into something and maybe go too far.,0,158

no wonder people hate to study history: this book is just plain bad. shame on david mccullogh for using the hype machine to push this on the public. the concept is great but there is no soul in the story.. it reads poorly.. and does not make you long to learn more about the people who and the time and importance of these events in american history. as a mtv video it would be great cuz it jerks around and has bits and bites of information. all the facts and quotes in this book do not add up to history told in a compeling story. not even to be considered junk summer reading. a fox tv report it would rate a c- by there standard!!!!!!!!,0,125
"twain on automatic pilot: twain could always come up with a good yarn, and this is as good as any, so far as plot is concerned. but this send-up of the sherlock holmes genre never really gets off the ground. a send-up should be funny. but there is too much in the plot that is evil and dark, so holmes' appearance -- and his incorrect solution -- become merely annoying. the reader on the tape version does what he can to keep things moving along, but he cannot stifle the inevitable feeling in the listener that this is twain churning out words for money. still, it is twain after all, and so it does have its moments. just not enough of them.",0,122

"rather disappointing: having read several good reviews from various critics, i lookedforward to this book's paperback release for some time. unfortunately,while lott seems to be have an adequate grasp of the language, hisstorytelling skills just do not rise to the same level.a whodunit of sorts is marred by an overly tedious narrative and far-too-convenient plot twists that ultimately lead to a flat climax. furthermore, the story is tied up just a tad too neatly--when the person........... you've no doubt seen any number of cheesy james bond villains do the exact same thing (""since i am going to kill you very soon, mr. bond, it doesn't matter if i let you in on my little secret, does it?""). ugh. take a pass on this one--it's not worth the effort. end",0,129

"a promising begining, but a pathetic ending: a man in full starts off with tremendous promise. wolfe again weaves the same rich tapestry of characters, who intersect in and out of one another's lives, much as he did in bonfire. i was really looking forward to a delicious climax. but less than half way through the book, we get lost. instead, the players who seemed to offer the possibility of such rich texture muddle about as charicatures of themselves, or of players we've seen before in bonfire or in other moral panderings. even the names of the characters are there to beat you over the head with wolfe's point: the sniveling sycophant named peepgas (honest, i'm not making this up), or the successful black lawyer, roger white, who is challenged by his ""blacker than thou"" friend, the mayor of atlanta. ultimately, the ending is beyond disappointment. my advice: read the first 1/2, then put it down and imagine your own ending. you'll be much happier than if you suffer through the last 300-400 pages.",0,174

"an unintentional primer for luddites: want to know why many people fear and loathe technology? read anything kurzweil has written. this book draws the incredibly arrogant conclusion that just because computers will soon surpass human being in computing power, they will become superior thinkers and spiritual beings.what a load of crap. tell me, who will write the software that exceeds human intelligence? the machines themselves? or perhaps the geniuses of modern computing, who can't even write code to shut down a modern pc without crashing it 20 percent of the time.this book is a catalog for sci-fi horrors. it happily forecasts a world with no privacy, filled with carbon-based morons even less willing than today to create works of art or use the one organ that sets us apart from other beasts.but,hey, it will be a great century for blow-'em up computer games.",0,143
"only for dedicated hawking fans: stephen hawking's black holes and baby universes and other essays is a compilation of approximately a dozen essays and presentations made by hawking from 1976 to 1992. though some of the essays deal with scientific issues (e.g. physics, cosmology, black holes) most of the book is autobiographical in nature discussing the author?s upbringing and struggle with alcs.written in the aftermath of the popular a brief history of the universe, the current work is a rather blatant effort to exploit hawking's popularity with minimum effort. although a short book (approx. 175 hardcover) there is much repetition amongst the essays. readers with even a passing knowledge of hawking will find no new information in this book.overall, a disappointing book that has little to offer. only for the most dedicated hawking aficionado.",0,134

"baby talk: i must say, i was disappointed by king's latest work. one of my favorite things about his novels is the way he delves deep into the minds of his characters. for example, in ""it"", he brought all of the intricate members of the losers' club to life.i found lisey as a character surprisingly flat; lisey herself didn't actually have a story, as the novel was centered around her late husband. i also found the 'secret language' between scott and lisey infuriatingly annoying and cutsy sounding, bordering on baby talk. it actually made me a bit embarrassed. a lot of the story was far fetched and unneccesarily disgusting (i know, i know, it is stephen king, but i mean in terms of this particular story and setting, a lot of it just seemed unnecessary and tacked in for impact).i'm happy for those of you who liked it, but this book wasn't for me. i'm going to go re-read ""it"" now. ;)",0,162

"i hated everyone of these characters!: i thank heaven that i do not have friends like these because if i did, i would run off to a desert island. i never saw such a bunch of new age-sensitive-getting in touch with our inner children-wimpy guys in my life! everyone is so self-absorbed, so-o-o sensitive, so-o-o rich and self indulgent- who could stand to be in a relationship with any of them?? these are the kind of guys who should all be working as therapists or social workers - that way, the only people who would have to listen to them would be desperately lonely people who would welcome any human contact. if i was ever at a dinner that included one of the conversations in this movie, i would pretend that my beeper had just gone off so that i could get the heck out of there on some false pretense!! what a pack of wimps! this script is nothing but a soap opera for gay men. i am gay and i hated it!! and them!!!",0,176
"cover design kills good case: this case is awesome for protection, very nicely design, feels tough. but when i actually had to use the pda, the cover just got in the way too much, and became a big annoyance.the front cover for this case flips down. so when you want to access the pda, you have two ways of holding it. one is with the cover dangling at the bottom of your device, banging into your palm. the other way is to fold the cover into the back, which is even worse since now the sharp inner edges are striking your palm, making using the pda for a long time very uncomfortable if not unfeasible.the cutouts are also not very precise. especially the mini usb connector. with the hinges in the way, i had to try very hard each time to push the cable in whenever i need to sync or recharge.overall, i don't recommend this case.",0,157

"okay writing, partially reliable history: irving wallace liked to write what were, for his day, very racy -- and very profitable -- novels. so it's natural that he was attracted to the story of ann eliza webb dee young denning, the serially married onetime polygamous wife of brigham young, and that he tended to play up the same kinds of things that he emphasized in his more obviously fictional books.at least ann eliza comes across, in wallace's recounting, as somewhat less perfect (and just a bit more believably real) than she does in her own exposé/memoirs, which were based upon her profitable run as a somewhat titillating paid lecturer in victorian america.incidentally, the book was never ""banned"" in the mormon church, contrary to the deliciously sinister folklore passed on by the previous reviewer. the mormon church has no list of ""prohibited books.""",0,142

"documentation is terrible and oddly non-formatted: i completely agree that the documentation is terrible and nonsensical. plus it is ""non-formatted"" and looks like maybe it once actually was before being stripped of all formatting. there is no pdf manual on their web site.after 1/2 hour i still can't get the display mode to change from degrees c to f. also, the altimeter sits there and fluctuates between -1 and 6 feet. why or why? i am upstairs in a house that sits around 30 feet above sea level. the manual says nothing about calibration of altitude except to say that you can ""set the current sea level pressure reading"". what the heck is that supposed to mean and how would i know what it is supposed to be anyway?",0,129

"pretty, but overrated: this book won't likely impress anyone who isn't already enamored with marvel comics superheroes.on one hand, it's beautiful and vivid and even a bit haunting.but it's also somehow hollow.consider- everything is at stake for these characters: their home, their culture, even their lives. and yet it's all handled with such cold, distant narration that it's impossible, as a reader, to care.little surprise, then, that in a collection of twelve dramatic, explosion-filled issues, the most striking and memorable moment is a quiet scene halfway through in which a normally unreadable character collapses to his knees at the side of his giant dog and hugs him.it's among the few moments of real weakness, conflict or feeling in the entire ponderous volume.the artwork usually manages to be delicate and intimate, but even the powerful illustrations can't compensate for a lifeless script.the inhumans ultimately serves as a long, rich, vivid description of nothing.",0,152
"waste of money: the watch face is decent, but the bands are not the color that is pictured in the description. they are actually lime green, khaki, black and not the olive green, khaki and dark brown shown. because the bands are interchangeable it adds a certain amount of discomfort and an awkward, cheap look when worn. the only color that actually looks presentable with the green face is the lime green band and that is a stretch. everything else seems to clash and doesn't blend. avoid this item.",0,89

"typical l subramanian - terrible: saraswati is a wonderful raga. but l subramaniam has not done enough justice in bringing out the complete structure of the raga. he has concentrated more on the aspects of speed, tala and rhythm, completely ignoring melody and imagination, thus making this album bland and boring like the rest of his compositions. the mridangam is again, just as cliched as the violin is. in summary, it is typical ""terrible"" l subramanian!",0,76

"sloooow, and never reaches its destination: awful movie. sloooow pacing with a bunch of little twists that never panned out. this story about a may/december love mismatch has potential, but the writer/director put way too many barriers in the way - besides the age difference there's also a language barrier and a different-career barrier (he's a budding violinist, she stays home and gardens). plus there's the creepiness factor in that the two old ladies practically kept him prisoner, refusing to let the authorities know they'd found him, apparently unconcerned that someone somewhere might be worried about him. and why make the pretty stranger seem so evil when all she wanted was to take the fellow under her wing and help him fly? why add the pretense of danger (oh no! they might be german spies!) if you aren't going to do anything with it? this story couldn't really decide where it wanted to go so it meandered around for a while and ended up going nowhere.",0,166

"poor execution: when i bought this book i was looking for a source of ""options"" that i could apply to the design of my own smart house. this is more of a coffee table book, not a useful reference. for some unknown reason the editor chose to print the text as white print on a black background, which i find almost as annoying as reading text that is entirely bold-face. on top of that the author chose to showcase several houses that are starkly contemporary and amazingly ugly in my opinion. in sum: this book has nothing much to offer the prospective home builder.",0,104

"patterns in imagination: written during the height of the late tech bubble, it often seems to have more faith, in a secular way of course, in the imagined promises of technology in general and software in particular. the similes are compelling, and the parallels are intriguing, but there's always some nagging question on what it all means. none of the short-term predictions have come to pass, and the long-term predictions are more in the way of philosophical musings of the author. and, the almost child-like respect for computer simulations is questionable, particularly when presented without any supporting arguments or explanations. not a book on technology as such, or anything really concrete or otherwise directly useful. some of the points bring to mind the clashes between the copenhagen and gottingen schools when quantum mechanics was being conjured up. a good read for speculative background on artificial intelligence.",0,146

this album is very stupid: this is one of the worst albums that davey vain has created. there r no big guitar riffs and it sounds like a acid trip. i am a fan but the no respect and the love is for strangers albums r much more superior. davey needs ta go back to his roots not to be like the cure. he also should stick to singing than playing the guitar.he needs also more input from the other bandmembers also.i think the lyrics need much more improvement also.i hope he starts to play something more like rock.this album is very mello for him.,0,105

"a remarkable collection of nonsense: i have rarely found so much nonsense compressed between the covers of a book. this a collection of unwarranted, groundless assertions, irresponsible generalizations and shameless one-upmanship. the success of the book in the 60's is proof of the intellectual despair that marked that decade, attempting to get out of the vietnam tragedy throug false gurus and other unsubstantiated claims to objectivity. the few pearls are buried under such a mountain of bull that it is not worth the effor to search for them. mr. mcluhan pretends to know about everything, and shows he knows absout nothing, with the possible exception of english literature. and even there, his judgments are rarely valid and most of the time intellectually irresponsible. this is not a serious book. future generations will look at it and judge our enthusiasm for it as proof of our immaturity. i gave it one star because i could not give it zero.",0,158

"eat pray love - pass: in short pass. i watched this drivel with my mother over the holidays thinking it would be a wonderful chic flick with beautiful travel cinematography. it was terribly boring, no great travel shots and a waste of our time. neither my mother nor myself are fans of julia roberts but thought perhaps this movie might be fine because of the travel. i only paid $1 from the kiosk rental but still not worth it. save your money and time - even if on sale. i agree with another reviewer the companions in italy were the most interesting part of the movie but never really developed the characters. the reason for the main character's up and leaving husband - the hopping in/out of bed from husband to flaky actor to sensual javier bardem. i could not emphathize with the character. too self absorbed and she brought the unhappiness upon herself. for a similar chic flick i'd rather watch under the tuscan sun which had a nice ensemble of characters that were allowed to develop; not eat pray love.",0,182

"dull and depressing: in the latter part of the book, marak wakens and has trouble remembering which passage through the desert he is on. that aptly sums up the plight of the reader. i forced myself to finish, because i kept thinking something would actually happen. the happenings in the book, however, given the context of endless desert travel, seemed contrived: dust storms (of course - what else can happen in the desert?); childbirth; tain's potshot; running out of water/food; desert predators; they all seemed inserted just because something needed to happen. compare, for example, to the key to rebecca, where the trek across the desert was brutal, but it was only a lead-in to the story, not the story itself. i also found the book depressing. the ""victory"" at the end was not an uplifting triumph, it was a non-event, framed by an apparent huge loss of life (although we never find out how many perished). i did find the hermaphroditic tower of the cover art interesting, though.",0,169

angel chimes: i had one of these when i was a child. it was delicate and probably inexpensive. but this one that i just bought puts a new spin on delicate and inexpensive - it's called flimsy and cheap! this one doesn't even ring the chimes when the candles are lit - the angels hit the chimes but they don't make a sound. and the whole thing is made of such cheap material that it easily bends and dangerously wobbles - not a good thing to do with lit candles. but of course the one i had as a child - 60+- years ago - was made in america.,0,109

"the partial image of a ghost of a story: i am a simple man. and when i read a story, i would like to have the entire story before me, and not be forced to go to the internet to find the rest of it!!!!!!!this volume, incredibly, omits the third and final chapter of ""a jolly corner""! it was an intersting experience, accidentally, because reading it without the last chapter made one confront the basic construct of the tale. it seemed incomplete after chapter two, but complete after chapter three. what was the missing element? the female character of absorption and empathy. so, i am glad that the compilation is a complete disaster, as it forced me to confront what this particular short story is really about: female human-ness vs male ego driven self-delusion.""washington square"" is the only truly great work in the collection. i loved it.i rate it a one because surely a person can read these stories on the internet in their complete form.",0,166

"new remaster available for a lot less money: a uk record company, bgo, that specializes in remastered reissues has released a newly mastered 2cd edition oflittle robbers, backed with ""all four one"" (the expandedcapitol editionreleased in the late 90's, also newly mastered).that set, with two albums and bonus tracks, is far less money, new, than the prices this old, tired, non-remastered single-album disc is being hawked for, used, here on amazon.for audiophiles, bgo respects the dynamic range of the original robbers lp, whereas most of the capitol motels' ""best of's"" have terrible loudness compression present (the essential collectionandclassic masters, the latter being really bad).",0,104

"idiotic software deployment requires the disc everytime.: the folks who designed this software should go back to kindergarten. how on earth does anyone make a software that does not install onto a hard drive, is beyond me? are these guys so paranoid about their intellectual property that they forgot the fundamentals of software deployment? not everyone likes to carry around a cd with their laptop, once a software is installed. i'm sick and tired of software designers who do not trust that many people who use software actually pay for it and buy it. josh waitzkin should reasses his association with ubisoft. in their brilliant attempt to thwart piracy, they have created a totally useless piece of software, especially for the 21st century.",0,123

"just showing his lack of military knowledge: the novel should be used as a textbook in elementray school. it is not only plotless, some of its assumptions are just, well assumptions. i wonder why pla would engage us in a situation like that. why pla wouldn't go all out when taiwan declared its independence? another good try on predicting future conflicts between major powers (which us always wins, off course). but the lack of knowledge and understanding of asian culture make this novel suited only for the not-informed americans. but again why would they care when they think they are always right.",0,102

"an accident: i had great expectations for this movie but it did not deliver. it's about the relationship that develops between a sheltered, over-religionized teenager, ben who goes to work for over-medicated, hyper-eccentric washed-up actress evie.the whole plot is predictable. it's obvious from the start that ben's home life is tottering from the weight of over-religion. you see that coming form the first few scenes and can predict almost how it will end up and it ends up like you imagine. evie's neediness borders on paralysis and it's painful to watch. julie walters plays a good turn as evie but with a lack of charismatic acting by fellow lead rupert grint, it falls on julie walters and she just couldn't carry the movie alone.",0,124

"horrible record label rip-off release: i'd give it zero stars if i could. record labels should be shot for releasing trash like this. this is already available as the live in 99 dvd. difference is, live in 99 is the full show; this is edited down to maybe half of that release and they resequenced the songs to where they are completely out of order from the way there were performed. example: george doesn't open with bad to the bone on live in 99 but does here. it looks stupid here because he is already sweaty whereas on live in 99, he opens with be bop grandma and is dry as a bone. be bop grandma appears about halfway through this release, so for him to start out soaking wet and be dry halfway through the show, it's just so inconsistent as to be stupid. the performance is great, but skip this and get the real deal for maximum enjoyment.",0,160

"i would not recommend this vacuum cleaner at all!: we had this vacuum cleaner purchased to use in cleaning our church. i had high hopes but was soon disappointed with how it did not hold together. the biggest problem was the wheels on the rug head. they fell off constantly forcing us to use duct tape and other measures just to keep it functioning. the hose connection is also weak and it would either overheat and quit or lose the connection, we are not sure which. we finally had to buy another vacuum cleaner after just two years, but for the money, this should last for years. move on with your search, in the long run this vacuum cleaner has too many faults and i want to save you that frustration.",0,131

"shut up and think: wow. the title is so offensive i just had to write the review. i did read the book, and while it presents compelling internal logic, i think it has a slight problem. internal logic doesn't need to consider external reality. that is why people claim that they can prove the ""international jewry"" run the media. a logic that does not take into acount the external is fiction, because it doesn't look at what is real. this sort of book i will call ""current event historial fiction."" for instance: despite what this book implies, the wealthy should probably have more of their income taxed than the poor. say you make $2.5 milion a year. given a 25% tax, you pocket $1,875,000 a year. if you make $25,000 a year, you pocket $18,750. yet the poor get taxed more than the rich because the rich supposedly earned all of their money, whereas poor and undereducated minority workers are lazy. i hate books that say that sort of thing.",0,170
"a disappointment for me...: i love atb, but i found this cd to be repetitive and just boring. the only track worth noting is ""the summer"", which sounds like he just took ""9 pm (till i come)"" and played it backwards.if you want to hear atb at his finest, check out his clubbers guide to trance from ministry of sound. i think that could very possibly be the best trance album to date. it's definately worth the steep import cost.themike",0,80

simply ridiculous: this author has written some great books in the series... however i feel completely defrauded by this purchase. catherine coulter has slapped a new title on previously released books in a series. i can tell you how irritated i am. email her your thoughts at: readmoi@gmail.com,0,48
daring to dream: this book was a total disappointment. it was completely predictable and quite boring unless you like to be entertained by the sexual descriptions. i must have missed something in this story as many past readers have raved about this book. i just thought it was a pretty weak plot.,0,52
"doesn't come with link spring: i thought that this was a reasonable price for the bed especially with the free shipping. the problem is that it doesn't come with the link spring frame that the mattress sits on. the description says it does not include accessories or mattress. i thought accessories meant the bedding. i would never assume the frame wasn't included. they need to be more clear. to order that part, shipped to my area is $172.14. that makes the cost of the bed closer to $800. i think i could have found it cheaper elsewhere. just do a search for saigon daybed on internet, other companies sell it.the only other thing is that the top piece on the back and the sides is wicker. it is pretty, but it looked like wood to me in the picture. i wondered where the wicker was!!",0,145
"don't waste your time and money- see the matrix instead: this was a poor movie, not even saved by two, or should i say one and a half action scenes- one where the major fights an uzi toting baddie and the end fight, with a bug-like tank. the music and environment shots were too long and horrible- as boring as blade runner. there are a lot of incomprehensible technotalk scenes and lots of philosophical psycho-babble scenes. plus, the animation is ugly. the major looks ugly, the men look poor, and there's a lot of black. while i didn't love the matrix, it too was confusing, it made alot more sense than ghost in the shell.",0,115
"nothing but rehashed garbage: i think i must have listened to a different album than these other reviews because i found nothing redeeming at all in this album.this was recommended to me by a friend (who incidently has poor taste in music), and after listening to the album, i can firmly conclude that this album is a waste of your time. every single song is an exact copy of some other more famous musicians work. i have yet to hear an original song, and believe me, i've looked! don't waste your money or your time with these guys.",0,98

"plot holes have turned me into a hater.: i liked this movie right after seeing it. but the more i thought about all the plot holes, the the less i began to respect the writing in this movie. now that i have had some time to think about it, i can say i hate this movie, and never want to see it again. i wont get into the confusing arguments about ""this happened because, the younger self did yada yada yada"", but i will say that after the last act of the film... none of the events prior should have happened -- but it did happen even though ""character xyz"" never existed. people still remember ""character xyz"" even though he/she never existed. this movie makes up its own rules to avoid paradoxes. these rules violate basic causality. this movie had some nice effects, and jgl's performance was really cool, but the lack of logic behind the basic premise if the movie is maddening.",0,163
"don't do it!!: if i could give a negative review for this i would. the hard drive worked fine up until yesterday when i tried to access it, and couldn't find it in the list! i had no way of accessing the drive. i tried everything - from rebooting my computer, turning the drive on and off, changing usb ports, and plugging it into a wall socket. nothing worked! i started google-ing around and found that other people had the same problem, and there wasn't really a solution for it. i even tried calling tech support, but they didn't want to help me unless i paid them $40 since my warranty for the drive was up. now my only option is to open that sucker up and to put it into a new enclosure. hopefully that will work or else all my stuff is lost! :(",0,146

"heartless: boulez has no heart, no emotion, no passion, and (i believe) no understanding, of the monumentality of this work.this is not a performance. it's a reading. all the notes are played rhythmically and precisely, without any emotional involvment in the score. the vpo is a great orchestra that produces the results its conductor wants. but when this dud of a recording was finished, the musicians probably left the musikverrein in total hysterics.for this recording, boulez is more to be pitied than lionized.it's simply awful.",0,85
"unusable book - and not for the content.: this book might be wrought with ageless wisdom, colorful history and practical horse sense- but who would know! the type is way too small (and my vision is perfect) and the text is too far into the spine. that adds up to one unpleasant reading experience-if you can even manage the arduous task of trying to read this book. time for a major reformatting by the publisher.",0,75
"painfully slow: the plot is about the paintstaking process researches go through to find a lost painting and the pace of this book is just as painfully slow. i finished it, but had to force myself to just keep reading. it reads like a novel, but it is a true story of researchers looking for a lost painting, the search requires, careful attention to detail, hours posting through the dead scrolls of family archives, if this sounds exciting to you, then go for it....don't be fooled by the back of the jacket or the reviews, you really don't learn anything about the artist, other than the fact his life wasn't that exciting, the lives of his researchers aren't that exciting.",0,120

"art or pomposity?: a massive attack fan to the death, i was sorely disappointed by this collection of videos. since the release of ""mezannine,"" i would say that del naja has become the bono of the early-mid nineties: pompous and a bit self-righteous. where i would have hoped to see some experimental music video directing, this collection is mostly a jumbled together collection of cheesecake closeups of the ever-scowling 3-d. advance listenings of ""100th window"" portends more pseudo-art from this great band. one expects more from the greatest band of the late twentieth century.",0,94
mothman fiction: the author claims the book is factual. my gut feeling is it's fictional. as fiction it is not well written. just a bunch of short tales kind of mixed together.,0,32

"abysmal!: as a soon-to-graduate kellogg student, i thought this text might give me better insight into the case interviews that the management consulting firms use while recruiting. i was disappointed to find that this book provides only a few pages on case analysis; the remainder of the book is devoted to such topics as ""seat visibility in the case classroom"". if dickens, dead drunk, were to try to write a very dry overview of the case method in a classroom setting, he might pen this text on a very bad day. save your money and go to vaultreports.com or weetfeet instead....",0,101

"hercules or xena, with a ""sword of truth"" world slapped on.: firstly, i loved sam raimi when he made hercules and xena. they were campy, and so fun to watch. the problem was, you never took them seriously. now, imagine one of the best fantasy series every written, and then make it hercules. it is painfully obvious that sam raimi never read more than perhaps the back cover of the book. it seems that they took his name from spider-man, and used that prestige and high budget to make the show.the cast (aside from zed) seems like they were picked from the phone book. richard, rather than a tall, built d'haran man, he is a small, skinny guy. ever woman in the midlands has hair just as long as kahlan's, and darken rahl isn't even blonde! while i'm positive that those who loved hercules or xena will enjoy this show, anyone who has ever read any of the books will want to sandpaper their eyes. i wish i could give this 0 stars.",0,173

"frustrating piece of junk: i agree with all that has been said before. before reading these reviews i thought the problem with my unit freezing and needing to constantly be rebooted was that it was a rare lemon. i have had a samsung dvr for years and have had flawless service out of it, and it is a dream to operate. i leased this second dvr for other household members and found it impossible to program and quite clumsy in operation. why do i need to push the guide button twice just to see the channel guide? why is it so slow in opening and changing operations? i canceled the lease, but directv in it's usual incompetency has not bothered to pick it up. i offered to drive 40 miles to deliver it to a retail store and they refused because it had to sent by fedex.",0,147

not a garrett pi series #2: i am a huge fan of glen cook's garrett pi stories. i really disliked passage of arms because it tried to tell about the adventure from several protagonist viewpoints. it's almost like he's trying to write an episode of the world he portrays as opposed to one person's adventure. it does add a lot of pages to the book if he is being paid by page.,0,72

"clash of the comic titans: the legendary teaming of w.c. fields and mae west has some hilarious moments, but does not make for classic cinema. ""my little chickadee"" (1940) is an unsuccessful patchwork of two comedic styles that simply do not mesh. in fact, the western satire works best when the stars keep their distance by doing their own thing. not surprisingly, the film was more successful for fields than for miss west - who detested the great man until the day she died. worth seeing for historical purposes.overall rating: **",0,91

"radiation hormesis - a one sided view: i was very disappointed in this unbalanced view the author presented. it fails to present supporting information that refutes the concept of radiation hormesis. many of the examples presented as hormesis are actually stress induced changes that may reduce the overall fitness of the organism. for example, the ecologic radon studies of bernard cohen which are stated to support hormesis have been shown by drs. r. william field and jay lubin to be without merit. however, i did find some of the writing heuristic.",0,91

"they abandoned rock: sugar ray was good at one time. rpm was an enjoyable little diddy, but as soon as they found out they'd make more money with that poppy acoustic rock, they got on their knees to make the audiences happy. although the cd is okay, it's too poppy for me. the best treat is by far the song ""stay on"" with nick hexum, frontman of the band 311. many people fail to realize hexum's vocals on this though, therefore it will be skipped. overall, this should appeal to all the bubblegum pop fans, as well as the blink 182 teenyboppers out there.music fans can pass on this one though, you've heard it before.",0,115

"outkast sucks! plain and simple: outkast is the absolute worst rap group to date.... they suck so bad. if anyone could explain to me how they are classified as rap/hip hop it would be greatly appreciated.... they should be under the genre of either funk or childrens music! this cd sucks just as much as their other ones.... actually it is probably their worst album to date. they have 3 songs that are good out of all their albums.... rosa parks, b.o.b., and ms. jackson...so just download them or dont get them at all..... worst album i ever heard!!!",0,99

"sanctimonious posturing: christopher hitchen's book ""no one left to lie to"" could have been great. i've always enjoyed his entertaining style and trenchant analysis in vanity fair. this book, however, is a huge disappointment. there may be insightful commentary buried in here, but it is under literally bucketfuls of invective, name-dropping, and self-aggrandizing. hitchens clearly lacks emotional distance from his subject and he comes off petulent and mean-spirited. while this book is quite short, the reading of it was as arduous a process as picking up war and peace in the original russian. not recommended.",0,95

"the online reviews are more interesting than the book: i expect that i am not alone in being highly amused by the inventiveness of some of the online reviewers for this book, whose acidic sense of humour and satire seems lost on the more sedate minds of others. might i suggest that 'sue d'eauymme, 'steven spielberg' et al seem to have the making of great comedy screenwriters? it would be interesting if any of their scripts ever came across jennifer lerch's desk!the book, incidentally, is a rather average concoction which borrows heavily from other volumes and seems to revel in stating the obvious. there seems little point in reading it unless you are completely in the dark about screenwriting.",0,119

rumble fish: rumble fish was not an exciting book.infact it was horribe i would not recommend this book to any reader. this book was written for special minds. this book is about rusty james and his brother moter cycle boy they think that they are all bad and all but they are not. they end up loseing it all in the end.,0,62
"why so long???????: first, the book was so long, and he never stops describing the characters, towns, villages and other various items untill it's been blown way out of perportion. and next, too many twisting subplots to follow. he writes on one untill some actuall action happens(about 300 pages later), then in the middle of the action, he starts on one that no one can even remember. ironic, isn't it. at the rate he's writing, hell be dead before the series is finished, and if he isn't, who will care about the climactic finish of him against the dark one. i certainly won't. the story seams to be getting more and more subplots, without tying any of them off. the first few books were colorful, but then the passion is suddenly gone, with olny one book.",0,136

"save your money. it's all in the manual.: since i am a filemaker beginner, i wanted a book to get me up to speed quickly. filemaker comes with two manuals, a ""getting started"" guide and a ""user's guide"". they are pretty good, but i was in a hurry and hoped that the visual quickstart guide would live up to its title. regretfully, the visual quickstart guide merely rehashes the same information that is available in the user guide. in most cases, i found the user guide's explanations to be clearer than those in this book. the author seems to have forgotten a basic principle - a book on a software product must add value to the product's included documentation. i found visual quickstart guide to be worthless in that regard. eventually, i gave up on it and simply used filemaker's manuals.",0,141

""maneater"" is a great track and illustrates another new dimension of this female vocalist'd msic-making.",0,133

"potential but needed more development: this book had such potential, but the characters were so static and did not develop or mature in any way throughout the novel. i was very disappointed in the protagonist's unemotional responses to emotional situations and subjects. mcdermott does have a beautiful style of writing, but she did not take these characters to the level that she could have. the ending was anti-climatic and frustrating.",0,70
"i hated this book: i am a 5th grader, and recently i was given an assignment to read this book. earlier in the school year, we read mrs. frisby and the rats of nimh, which was good, but i didn't enjoy it as much since i had read it many times in kindergarten and first grade. the book is boring and fast-paced, and it seems like jane leslie conly has perhaps watered down the writing, perhaps to make it less difficult. the book got considerably better in the end, but still it was poorly written and boring. the plot was actually quite good, but the way everything went so quickly was confusing, and yes, i didn't like it. it was also too long for such a dull book. usually i would think that 278 pages is short, but the way it drags on, it was a slow read for me. however, some parts were interesting, nevertheless, the first one was much better. i enjoy books by j.k rowling, brian jacques, anne mccaffrey and others.",0,174
"not worth the money!: i was very disappointed at the book overall. i bought the book based upon the raving user reviews, but found them to be totally untrue. it keeps on going back and forth between similar subjects. it's very repetitive and didn't give me what i was hoping to learn from reading this book.i honestly wouldn't recommend it to anyone, not even to beginners because it will probably confuse you more than enlighten you.",0,76
sherlock holmes and the secret weapon: first let me say that i'm one of the biggest sherlock holmes fans in the world. i have been waiting for years for someone to produce a dvd version of the basil rathbone movies. this is my second dvd sherlock holmes movie from the focusfilm entertainment group and it is no better than the first one. this one is going to be returned just like the first one was. this dvd tranfer is so dark in places you can not see the movie at all. the contrast is terrible and the orginal film had black dots and white streaks all over the place. the sound quality of this tranfer was fair. i have vhs copies of this movie that are twice as good as this dvd version. i hope someone besides focusfilm will starts making dvd tranfers of this great series. please save your money for a better product in the future. ---this text refers to the dvd edition,0,165

"not what it claims to be: when a publisher presents a book as being a work of history knowing that its author's research is suspect to say the least, i believe the consumer has every right to be upset about that.the problem with this book is not the occasional error or fact or misprint but that the author made claims to his qualifications and research that when checked turned out to be very questionable to say the least.it seems he was never a lord as he claimed, nor ever a baronet as he claimed, nor a phd as he claimed. one asks oneself the question why somebody would need to make all these suspect claims if this book was really what it has been made out to be, namely a work of history.it is however a very good read. that is why i give it one star. it is entertaining. i only hope somebody writes a biography of its author one day (how's this for a title - ""the man of many names"") as i am sure that will be even more entertaining.",0,183

"if you have a relationship with god and are set apart don't buy this book: now, i must admit one night i was sitting watching television and i heard her ministering on tv about some things and she mentioned this book coming out. at that point i felt the holy spirit and thought it was so coincidental for me to see her right at that moment, because i never watch television and so on and so forth. so, i jumped on-line and pre-ordered the book. i struggled to somewhere in the 2nd chapter and then put it to the side. there was no god or holy spirit ministering in that book. i either threw it away or gave it away. the sound of god is very distinct and if it wasn't in the 1st 2 chapters i wasn't wasting my time trying to find him in the rest of it. so, if you are anointed, set apart, prophetic, peculiar don't look to hear your fathers voice in this one. sorry!",0,170
"a miserable attempt to give life to a great book: it's always been my personal belief that if you aren't going to stay true to a novel, then you shouldn't make a movie about it. this movie was in no way, shape, or form either the vampire lestat or the queen of the damned. it was a pathetic attempt to gather some actors together, have them hiss and bare their fangs, and play music. the producers should never have tried to make this movie. they have no concept of being true to a novel, of characterization, or even of the concept of a plot.",0,104

"could be better: i think the plot of this movie was the difference between being loving and being selfish in an unberable and confusing situation. the plot and christian perspective was a bit limited and could have been further developed. there were a few special effects that occured with more frequency as the movie progressed. these were better than i expected, but could have been better. the whole movie seemed a bit amateurish but i appreciated the christian perspective it portrayed.",0,81
"could have been so much more: summary: disjoint and superficial.the author had access to an outstanding group of individuals and in many cases squandered the opportunity with superficial questions. instead of getting key insights, i felt like i was getting trivia. the interviews read more like something from people magazine (or maybe a sidebar in a keyboard/music magazine) than a highly rated book. where is the depth that kettlewell should be able to provide?i found it impossible to get through section two. the intent may have been to be exhaustive in its list of pioneers, but instead i found it exhausting - dry, dull, superficial and disjoint.in addition the book is poorly edited, as if rushed to publication.",0,118

great idea - disappointing product: i bought this after reading negative reviews of waterpik products. i had used the waterpick for years and liked it but it finally broke. the company shipped the product quickly and everything was very good quality. the problem is it just doesn't work. it is more like holding a water hose to your mouth. the water stream is not fine and directed enough to really remove particles and plaque. the oscillation feature of the waterpick cleans much more quickly and deeply. i sent it back after trying it and nearly drowning a few times. i rate the company highly as they were very helpful about returning it and getting my money back. maybe they can improve the design so it really does what it is supposed to do.,0,133

"mobile library: the greatest thing about this product is that it is a mobile library. most people don't have a plethora of space to store their books. this device could revolutionize the future of reading.the downsides are that it is extremely expensive and then it costs additional money to add books (about $10 or less a book). secondly, there are only so many books you can get and most of them are more current and mainstream. if you are a fan of books that are older and maybe less popular, you're out of luck. while the demand remains for this product however, the list of books will grow.in short, i would only recommend this product for people that can't keep books with them for space or because they travel a lot. if you already have a large book collection, i wouldn't go getting rid of it for this product. besides, what if your power goes out for a week and you can't charge it? what are you going to do, stare at it?",0,173

"not that good: this book has a lot of promise and a seemingly good message, but it does not succeed. the author is too long-winded and seems obsessed with the sexual aspect of the post-world war ii american woman's problem. in my opinion she does not focus enough on the educational aspect. the book could have been condensed to half its size, and that would have made for a much better read. you could skip a page or two and not miss anything important. i found myself bored with the repetition and rushing to get through it. basically, it's a bunch of words speckled with a profound thought every 100 pages or so. however, for someone looking for a timeline of women's history in the early to mid 1900s, chapter 4 is very good.",0,134

"major flaw: installed backup pump per instructions 2 months ago. tested the backup pump by unplugging main pump and filling sump pit with garden hose. everything worked fine and gave me a peace of mind that i no longer need to worry about power outages when i'm gone. i went down today to check battery level and that checked okay. it was raining this morning so i had a chance to see main (zoeller 57) pump cycle on. that's when i notice water shooting out the bottom of the backup pump. it told me the cheap, garbage, mini check that zoeller uses on their backup pump failed. i should have followed advice and my instincts to remove their check and use a better check in the system.zoeller should be ashamed that they compromise what would be a good product had they spent a couple bucks more on a better check.i now have to remove the whole system and rebuild it. what a pain.this one major flaw in the design of the pump means that i can't recommend this pump unless you upgrade the check.",0,184

"what was the point of that?: yes michael cunningham is a wonderful writer of prose, but it is inserted in unrealistic streams of consciousness revelations during his characters' mundane activities. the lack of action in this book causes the focus to be on the characters who are revealed as self-absorbed, narcissistic and somewhat delusional while consistently whiny. it is not hard to discern why this book, as insignificant as it is, has been lauded by the press and hollywood. it caters to sympathies that the press and hollywood universally suscribe to without a search for greater truths or real meaning. additionally, the writer creates no sense of urgency or intrigue for the reader. it is the equivalent of watching a soap opera in which the writers are trying their best to write like shakespeare.",0,134

"horrible kindle experience at a rip-off price: delillo is one of the greatest american fiction writers, and ""white noise"" is a magnificent novel. but don't buy the kindle edition, which will completely destroy your reading experience. for some reason, the text loads to the device with a line space between every single paragraph.that's right. a line space between every single paragraph. like this.and that means there's also a line space between every line of dialogue, even if a character speaks only a couple of words.the result is so disorienting, and such an insult to the author, that i bought the physical book (not from amazon, i might add). if you love literature, throw away your kindle and buy real books from real bookstores. at $13 plus shipping, kindle downloads aren't even a bargain any more.",0,135

(that's why i gave it 2 stars instead of 1.) then i started googling and found it seems to be some sort of design problem with these cameras. that wouldn't bother me much if canon was willing to work with people but i was quoted the same roughly $100 repair price as an earlier reviewer with the short 3 mo. warranty on the repair. if i trusted that the camera would actually stay fixed, i'd do it because otherwise i really like the camera. but i don't trust it and i'm not impressed with canon's customer service. i previously had problems with a kodak digital camera and kodak was good about repairing it free of charge even when the warranty had expired.so i'm staying away from canons now.",0,157

not much better than yahoo maps!: it is not worth paying for the same features you get on yahoo maps. in the nyc area commercial vehicles are not allowed on the garden state parkway or the holland tunnel. i thought with this program one could tell it to avoid those routes. this program cannot do that. our company just spent almost $40.00 on software that is no more functinal than yahoo maps. the only thing that is nice is that there are no ads.,0,84
"don't waste your money on this dvd release!!!: the movie isn't half bad for a spaghetti western comedy, however the idea of east meets west was much better executed in red sun (1972) starring charles bronson & toshiro mifune. the one star rating is for the awful dvd transfer you are getting. the source material must have been a poor quality vhs copy complete with plenty of stretch marks (visible throughout movie),which in turn used a totally worn out 16 or 35mm print as its source. if you are a die hard eli wallach fan, and you want to see him in a fairly hard to find movie, then by all means, buy it. to everybody else,i recommend waiting for a better quality dvd release that will do this movie justice. better yet, give ""red sun"" a try.",0,138

"memoirs for his family on some mediocre lived life: the style of the author is like listening to a person that likes to talk about himself all the time. kinda reminds me of the 1980 movie ""airplane"" when the ex-fighter pilot tells the story of his life to the passengers; they end their lives in different ways after having to hear him...there are no issues if you planned on finding one. there is no summary and never any conclusion to the issue of racism. it is an amusing story of a 36 year old that has dillidallied in the fight for black power. his talk about racism is not scientific nor scholar but simply comes across as to what he's heard. just alot of personal events that make you dizzy in trying to remember that the author indeed has a point to tell after all the irrelevant details of his story come in pages after pages of paper product.amusing, yes, informative, no. i cant see either whites or blacks reading this and taking him seriously. so who's left? nah, us latinos just nod our heads...",0,185

"mythguided nonsense: oh, how i am loving the harry potter series (over and over again...) but great steaming dragon bogies: this 'sourcebook' is too much! inspiration-spotting really isn't a spectator sport, i guess, but the whole 'harry was once in a boat, so the author obviously intended us to be reminded of jason and the argonauts' approach is just shoddy thinking, surely? there are genuine mythical and spiritual roots to the potter stories - but you won't find them here. the fact that the disclaimer - 'not approved by j k rowling' - was hidden in gold lettering on gold background on the cover design suggests to me (alas, spotted too late!) that the book is trying to pass itself off as something it isn't. a blind guide. for goodness' sake, hold out for something rowling does approve - and in the meantime, let's trust our own imaginations!",0,148
"i purchased the first starter kit by pelican: the one that included a travel case, 4 disc jackets, screen guard, car charger, usb data cable and a polish cloth anyway i didn't much care for it. the usb cable is too short to comfortably put the psp on the desk while transferring files. the cable is only about 2 feet long so its only long enough to sit on top of the pc which isn't too safe because it could fall. the car charger is cheap because earlier today the thing burned out and when i noticed it the thing was very hot to touch. i had to pull it out of the dc outlet with a napkin! i'm starting to question pelicans accessories especially since the recall of the power brick now this. on to other things the case holds 4 umd's with the jackets on, but the two that go in the flap part of the case puts pressure on the psp screen which over time probably could damage it.",0,172

this book has no sense of organization: this is a pretty disorganized book by any standards. the author seems to have no sense of what he is trying to teach. it would have been so helpful if he had just had the reader create a project from scratch. instead he jumps from from one topic to the next and then back again. if you want to learn oracle dont buy this book. the best thing that i can say about this book is that it may serve as a solid reference after you have mastered oracle.,0,96

"poor contrast due to reflections: i was not happy with this keyboard for one reason...reflective paint on the keys. if the keyboard was used in a completely dark room, it would work great, but the light from my monitor reflects off of the keys, resulting in a very low contrast between the keys and the illuminated letters on the keys. the tops of the keys should have been painted with a matte, non-reflective black, so that the blue light shining through the letters would be more in contrast. in real life use, the visual ergonomics are very poor.i think this keyboard is a great concept, but it was poorly realized. the light from a monitor reflects off of the keys, creating almost a silver look which is very low contrast to the illumination color.i also purchased a small zippy illuminated keyboard which is much easier to read. however, the zippy is only slightly larger than a laptop keyboard and i wanted a full size, so i ordered the eclipse.",0,169

"a realistic life of lucas would have been more interesting.: great acting, ok directing and terrible writing. washington, ejiofor and crowe and great as usual, scott seems to be bored and the writing might just be mediocre if it wasn't claimed to be ""based on a true story."" among the bizarre claims is that frank lucas' collaboration ""lead to the conviction of three-quarters of the ny dea."" reality: zero convictions. he only testified against fellow dealers. also his relationship with bumpy johnson has been falsified. johnson's widow calls lucas a liar and the movie false. these are just two of about a half dozen major distortions. gangster movies are apparently going back to godfather style fantasy rather than to realism.",0,120

"hopelessly outdated: yes, it is a pleasant, lightweight read, but contrary to some of the other reviews here, this book is not ""somewhat"" outdated - - it is completely outdated. anyone who knows anything about ancient egypt can just look at the inaccurate information in some of these reviews and see how misinformed readers of this book will be -- for example thuthmosis iii (the accepted ""modern"" spelling is thutmose from the egyptian transliteration, more closely djehutymose) was not 4'6"" -- that is a measurement of his mummy, minus his detached feet and lower legs. he more likely was about 5'6"" tall, a very respectable height for an ancient egyptian. as for thutmose iii being a ""hero,"" this is a man who, solely for profit, invaded foreign countries, killing, maiming and plundering, carrying goods and slaves back to egypt, leaving countless impoverished widows and orphans in his wake. it is so sad to think that a mass murderer is anyone's definition of a ""hero.""",0,164

overrated: the previews from the were movie overrated it more than it should had been. i almost fell asleep on the movie a couple of times. i thought it was like none stop action but it was just like a typical movie like sum of all fears or deep impact. it was alot of talking and before you know it the action is over and back to talking again. i would go see it in the movies or rent it because its not worth you buying it. once you see it once there is no need to see it again so please dont waste you money on thsi movie.,0,109
"boring mess of sludge: sorry but i have to edit my last review. at first i gave this album the benefit of the doubt and rated it 4 stars but after multiple listens it has failed to grow on me, unlike the great white pony did. the album is just boring and overly noisey. who mixed this thing? you can barely hear the vocals at all, they're buried under all the sludge. some songs brake away from the monotony such as the explosive opener ""hexagram"" which is as melodic as it is brutal. ""bloody cape"" would be a good track on around the fur. and contrary to most fans beleif, ""anniversary.."" is a wonderful ballad which almost makes up for the horrible failure of ""teenager"" on white pony. the rest of the album just sends me to sleep, including the my bloody valentine sounding ""minerva"". overall, deftones is a dissapointing album. it lacks both the emotion of around the fur and the growing vision of white pony.",0,167

"disappointing: the eddings have always been likeable for their commentry on the human condition via the use of archetypal characters that represent one type of person (ie, tolnedrans are materialistic, angaraks are religiously fanatic etc) what this book fails to do is to come up with characters that are original to eddings' work! for example, longbow is strongly reminisent of hettar, rabbit of silk, eleria of flute, etc etc etc.coupled with this lack of characterization, is an overall lack of oomf. the story just does not motivate one to keep reading - i only stuck with it becuase i kept hoping that the plot would shift up a gear. it didnt.this book offers nothing that earlier eddings doesnt provide in abundance, and furthermore, it just isnt an entertaining read. the style is strained and unnatural, and seems forced.save yourself some time and money: avoid this book.",0,146

what a waste of a good title: why did the author even bother making this a holmes story? if he wanted to write a victorian sci fi/fantasy story did he have to use holmes and watson as his protagonists? fails to capture either the flavour of the original stories or the period. in addition the plot is convoluted and required an effort to stay interested. i did in the hope that it would get better towards the end but i felt cheated by the time i finished.,0,87

"just not that good: disappointing. this book is not particularly well-written. heller waxes majestically about the scenery and topography he sees, but i still can't visualize it. and he shifts his voice several times throughout the book, sometimes writing as if he were delivering sacred text, other times casually reaching out and attempting to speak to the reader one-on-one. it's hard to get a feel for the story he's trying to tell. add that to the fact that there is not a single compelling character in the book and it makes it a little tough to slog through. i find that i just don't care what happens to these people. and this may sound silly, but an adventure book without pictures of the location is a bad idea. i hate to sound like i'm in 4th grade, but it would have been really helpful to have some visual aids to understand the geography they were in and the effect of the water on their kayaking. no photos. it hurts the book.",0,171
"anne lamott's ""operating instructions"" is much better.: i read a lot of books about motherhood before i had my son, while i was trying to figure out whether it would be really worth it.

(it really is wonderful but it sort of consumes you too.) reviews seemed to indicate that this book had a revealing confessional honesty but i didn't find anything new here and it wasn't particulary well written. anne lamott's ""operating instructions - diary of my son's first year"" contains many more ""yes! so true."" moments and is more funny, and touching and beautifully written. to put it more succinctly, i laughed and bawled several times while reading ""operating instructions"" but this was kind of a bore.",0,174

(all shoes, hair clips, and accessories came off before going in) they treated it as gently as they possibly could. unfortunately, it ripped along a seam within the first month. we made several attempts to fix it, but it continued to get small rips in different places along the seam and never held air again. so disappointing. it's seriously just a poorly made product.",0,125

"safire is no novelist: i usually love this kind of novel, but scandalmonger offers precious few of the usual novelistic pleasures. there is very little scene-setting, all of the characters seem two-dimensional and generic, and the dialogue is stiff. here's the work of a man who's done all the research, and has the intelligence to cobble it all together into a plot, but who sorely lacks the ability to bring his material alive as a work of art. my advice: for historical fiction of this type, stick with gore vidal (e.g. burr, 1876, and the truly wonderful washington dc). vidal may be a little looser with the facts, but he offers a far more satisfying reading experience.",0,117
"complete fiction, not a biblical account.: although the book was an interesting read, it was very disappointing. it was not a biblical account and missed every opportunity to reflect on the positive in the people who were the beginnings of the jewish/christian faith. i will agree that there is a lot of scandalous and negative behavior in the early historical accounts of the bible, but this book made every attempt to dramatize and scandelize while omittimg anything edifying. there was no respect given to the god of abraham and that i have to say was the most disappointing part. there are way better books that are interesting to read, give an accurate historical background, and hold true to the integrity of the word of god.",0,125

"could have been better: a mediocre treatment of a terrific subject. the capsule summaries have to be short, (or they wouldn't be capsules) but too often they fall flat, barely catching the essence of the film. calling this book an ""illustrated guide"" is stretching the truth almost to the point of breaking. the illustrations are sparse, and aren't even from the cartoons themselves, but from advertisements for the films.it really pains me to be critical of the work, but there is enormous room for improvement. raving over it might well discourage another author (or even the originals) from producing a better work.",0,102

"fans of this book: i can't resist any longer, i must finally just state it baldly: conservatives are borderline illiterates. the reviews of this book have made it so clear. poor spelling, punctuation and grammar: loved it. good spelling, punctuation and grammar: did not love it. does this matter? well, as it indicates a lack of little things like education and involvement in the world -- the real world, not a.m. radio -- i think it does. i promise i will take the conservative line seriously when it comes spelled and punctuated properly.",0,93

"not much new here....: tarzan and the forbidden city has all the usual elements of the formula: cruel villians, some comedy, lovely heroines, and threatening wild beasts. the first half of the book was better than average pulp adventure. here, the pace moved quickly; the story's main conflicts emerged in the midst of burrough's evocative depictions of the threatening and unknown regions of the african jungle. however, towards the end, the tension bogs down into a series of relentless and wild action sequences where cliffhanger follows upon cliffhanger, stretching the bounds of plausibility, even for a tarzan story.",0,98

(try disney preschool.) or, at least, a theme that's a little more laid back. (for example, pooh preschool, where the goal is to help everyone finish their work so they can make it to a party.) i also highly recommend jumpstart preschool.my daughter is at the young end of the recommended age group, so maybe she will grow into it more. for 3 yr olds, i recommend staying away from this one.",0,176

""he's walking."" page 2. ""he's still walking."" page 60 ""he's still walking.""i understand the film crew and volunters doubled as actors (that explains so much--trust me) and now they are on amazon writing rave reviews for this dvd. let's cut to the chase. this is a absolute waste of time and money. consider yourself warned.",0,125

they should have recalled this one: revolting. repulsive. turgid. vile. nauseating. did i leave any perjoratives out? this is one of the most disgusting movies i've ever seen. it's nothing more than a big budget slasher movie that borders on the pornographic. how respectable actors like jude law and forest whitaker can involve themselves in such dreck is beyond me. how this project was ever greenlighted is equally unfathomable. there may have been some dark humor to be mined by the film's dubious premise but as executed here it's just unpleasant. do yourself a favor and avoid this sadistic exercise. poking hot needles in your eyes would be more worth your while.,0,112
"what?: i looked forward to this book for a long time, expecting the care, depth of character, and attention to detail that characterizes other books by this author, but was sadly disappointed. it is sloppy and frequently goes for the cheap shot. if you're going to keep characters and prolong a story it would be nice if they maintained integrity. although krendler sure got his. i wonder who actually wrote this book, 'cause it sure doesn't sound like mr. harris. i'll stick with silence of the lambs. save yourself time and trouble and read something else.",0,96

"a disappointing production of a great novel: this version of the scarlet pimpernel is infinitely inferior to the 1982 version starring anthony andrews, jane seymour, and ian mckellan. the screenplay is incoherent and confusing; events necessary to the understanding of the story are shown in flashback, usually long after the viewer needs the information. the dialogue runs the gamut from the witty to the banal (the prison scene between marguerite and percy exhibits the most offensively trite dialogue). but the worst aspect of this video is the casting of elizabeth mcgovern as marguerite. even playing a former actress is a stretch for her. richard grant as percy and martin shaw as chauvelin are quite good, although not nearly as good as anthony andrews and ian mckellan in the same roles.the scarlet pimpernel is a wonderfully heroic, romantic story set in the french revolution. this 1998 a&e production does not do it justice.",0,152

"good lens quality -- fragile earpieces.: as an owner of 6 or 7 pair of polar optics / solar shield sunglasses, i've experienced most every problem this brand is capable of having. the lens quality is excellent, but earpieces are very fragile. so why continue to pay 20 bucks each for so many pair? well, until about two years ago, warranty was great. a simple email was all it took to get an exchange pair, no matter what the problem. then the emails went unanswered -- maybe they changed ownership, or fired the ""good"" warranty lady. so i tried the new customer service contact info. oh sure, no problem, just send them in prepaid -- with proof of purchase -- oh yeah and be sure to include $5 or so for ""handling"". the old lifetime guarantee is now a year -- and for sure, the earpieces will be shot before the warranty expires.solar shield polarized glasses",0,156

"dramatization of degeneracy. vile and disgusting.: the main character of this movie is a filthy whore who plunges the depths of self-degradation in pursuit of some man to love her. her male romantic interest is a morally corrupt libertine who uses and disposes of an endless series of one-night stands. the script contains some of the most obscene dialogue and situations i've ever heard or seen in a movie. yet, for modern america, this is a ""romantic comedy"", and the movie's target audience of twenty-something, white, urban professionals will identify with the utterly soulless, amoral and promiscuous protagonists. what a sad commentary on our people. what a depressing testimony to the depths to which humans can sink.",0,117

bad design: i received this item approximately 10 days ago and am not at all happy with it. first of all the top that supposed to fit on it does not stay in place. it does not lock into place like it supposed to do. if you bump the can the top falls of. the sound it makes is so faint it does not bother my cats. the air sprayed out within 4 days and it was mostly when a person was near it and not the cats. i called the manufacturer thinking it was a defective top and they sent me another which does the same thing.total waste of my good hard earned money.,0,115
too much psychobabble: the nibble theory has some interesting illustrations. and it's central point - about the uniqueness and value of each individual - resonates with western cultural values. but the book is long on psychobabble and short on provocative insight. 80 pages could be better used by a clearer presentation of new ideas.,0,54

"junk.... bad history and bad action...: don't be a lemming!while oft considered a ""classic"" and ""accurate"" concerning medieval warfare and scots history, it is neither! the writer himself said that he ""...never lets history get in the way of a good story...""! if you can't make the real history of these times into a good story, then perhaps screen writing is not your true calling!the plot is perfectly adequate, as is the acting. the action has little to do with ""realism"" or true medieval warfare. the history? just plain wrong! wallace was not a scots/pict warrior in woad, but a knight in armour. robert the bruce did not ride for edward i and betray wallace. absolute rubbish.if you want a tear-jerker and schmaltz, buy this film. if you want a good action and history flick, avoid this like the plague!",0,140

""plan nine from outer space"" begins to look like oscar material by comparison.with the exception of the lead, joe schenck,cute and likable, the acting is cringe inducing.the script is silly ,sophomoric and so confusing that the viewer never quite knows what is going on which naturally leads to not caring about knowing what is going on. my bf and i finally pulled the plug about three quarters of the way through. i guess we'll never know how it turns out not that we'll ever give that a second thought.save your money, don't buy this dreck. what were these queens thinking? or more accurately, not.",0,115

"very frustrating ........................: the author does not let the stories speak for themselves. i found many questions arising about the strangeness of the stories, but no attempt was made to answer them. and because there is no probing reflection applied, some stories look contrived. strangeness that is not scrutinized just looks like someone seeing what they want to see.the stories read as if all involved enjoy being mystified and have no interest in rationality and understanding. in fact, one story seemed like a pathetic justification, born of regret.the author says, ""...i have no explanation for these strange romantic encounters."" there is no indication anywhere that he tried to find one, and plenty of weight of evidence that he actually tried to avoid one. otherwise, guess what? maybe no book!",0,129

"he misunderstands sovereignty: unfortunately, this author is one of many who misunderstand what calvinism means. he views free-will and sovereignty as polar opposites. the more sovereignty exerted, the less room for free will there is. it's tragic, but oh so common when stuff like this gets into print. the reason is that he equates god's sovereignty with the type of sovereignty that man has the capacity to exert. with man, they would be polar opposites, but god's sovereignty is so much larger and greater than what we can exert that there is room for free-will to operate within the spectrum of god's sovereignty. there is no conflict or paradox, and nearly all hunt's points are erroneous due to failing to understand this.",0,122

"poor quality, but works: i bought this as a motorcycle helmet lock, for which it works great except the lock itself is is totally cheap. i don't even care so much about the level of security, as this is just a deterrent so somebody can't easily walk off with my helmet; but locking it and unlocking it takes forever. to unlock, when you turn the key it doesn't just release or even disengage so you can pull the pin out, you have to wiggle the key to get it to disengage, and at the same time wiggle the pin while tugging. then to lock it, it's just as difficult. you don't need the key, but the pin doesn't fit well and has to be wiggled and forced. like i mentioned, this type of lock with this length of cable is perfect to use as a motorcycle helmet lock,but i would shop around for one with a better lock. the only thing i would add is both the lock and cable are wrapped in a rubber casing and shouldn't scratch your motorcycle, which is why i chose this model. however, for $5 you get what you pay for.",0,197

"worms not visible!: the children's area of our museum has this toy. they keep healthy worms in it at all times (i asked). however, we have yet to see a single worm and we check every time we go (we've been doing this for over 2 years). the worms never bore near the sides.the toy is also cheaply made, the area in the picture you see that looks like rock is styrofoam. it isn't very big. and the sides scratch easily. the dark covers on either side are cheap cardboard and don't last long either. our museum attendants have had to replace them with thick black cardboard pieces. even with the thicker, darker covers against the plastic sides, the worms won't dig near the sides.this toy is a good concept, but poorly done and a total waste of money.",0,139

"disappointing - too much fluff and retrospection.: i was very disappointed in this film. i expected something akin to saving private ryan and got ""i'm a broken-hearted deserter with a flawed conscience"". too much emphasis on the ""kinder, gentler side of combat soldiers"" versus the real courage, anguish, and horror of war. too sensitive to classify as a war movie and not enough focus on real soldiers. from my experienced point view, the combat scenes were overplayed, unrealistic, and totally overshadowed by hollywood's poor attempt at collective left-wing conscience. regret i spend the money to see it.",0,97

"not too many laughs...: this is a pretty silly movie. the idea of someone holding up a place at gunpoint, taking hostages, and the hostages eventually sympathizing and siding with the robber... well, it's been done before and much better. the talent of nia long is wasted in this movie. most of her screen-time takes place at the very beginning and end of the film.i gave this an extra star simply because jamie foxx has some funny moments in this. he's a major talent and really deserves to do better films than this. he's a great actor, both comic and dramatic.the dvd features certainly don't make up for the poor quality of the film. besides the film's trailer (and a few trailers for other trimark films) the only feature is a four minute interview with jamie foxx.",0,137

"worked great- now broken after 11 months.: this heater works well when it works. i put it away in the spring and took it out the other night to find that it no longer gets power. i contacted their customer service for repair/replacement, and it's going to cost me $22.50 (ups ground) to send it in for service + whatever packaging materials i have to buy. it is also distracting until you get used to the clicking (i am assuming it's the timer making the noises).overall, i don't think i would purchase this heater again.",0,95

"what is this????: i'm a newbie to this zope, and would really like to see some working examples of this product, so i can at least compare what is correct to what is in this book. none of the examples i've come across so far work! what's worse; i cannot figure out what's wrong with them because i do not know zope yet! i bought this for $., and i guess for examples, its ok. but man, if you want to come across as an authority in something, it wouild be helpful to make your books' examples workable.",0,98
"the videos aren't bad, but the presentation is horrible...: ""all is full of love"" is a brilliant video in every respect - it's perverse and transcendent at the same time, mixing in humaniform robots with flowing water and hard ceramic - it looks like the future of robot porn.however, what makes me only able to listen to it for brief periods is the menus. whoever decided that it'd be a good idea to play a hideous cacaphony of every song on the disk, apparently played backwards and at high speed during the menu screens, ought to be horsewhipped for ruining an otherwise good disk. (even if it is chris cunningham.) when the menu screens make you want to take the disk out and throw it out the window, you gotta reconsider the wisdom of doing that.fortunately, i believe that ""all is full of love"" is available on another bjork video collection, so i'll buy that and sell this one to the local cd/video concern.-darren maclennan",0,165
an uneventful book: i found the summer of the swans very boing and uneventful. there was not much goin on and it was not somthing i was interested in. there were very few interesting parts of this book. and i found the story didnt really have a very sturdy plot to it. there was not really any piont to it and i would have read a rather book instead. you may end up liking this book but i didnt really like it.,0,82

"a disappointing dvd: the ""sonic christmas blast"" dvd consists of the sonic christmas blast special (about 22 minutes long) and 3 sonic underground episodes. the christmas episode itself seems like only a child would enjoy it (and probably a young adult that saw the special when it originally aired in the late 90's). the animation and plot is laughably simple and ridiculous.as for the 3 sonic underground episodes, they're terrible. children might be confused by the sudden change of characters and plot when the christmas special ends and the underground episodes begin. underground is a completely different series in which sonic has a brother and sister and is on a quest to find their mother. the animation consists of moddy dark colors, the plot itself is a little dark (very much so for a children's cartoon) and in each episode sonic and his siblings sing a terrible song that makes barney seem like pavarotti.if you're buying for kids, it may be a decent dvd. otherwise, i wouldn't bother.",0,168

"the light in the forest is for babes in the woods: the light in the forest is about a white boy in the 1800's who is captured by native americans as a small child. the book is all about his return to and escape from his white family. it has a very shallow plot and the author seemed to take a very long time explaining a small action or custom. in the beginning, the chapters jump from the viewpoint of the main character, true son, to that of a soldier who observes his actions. the changing of viewpoints makes the book very hard to follow. i do not think a teen or pre-teen would enjoy this book, though i would recommend it to a younger and more naive group of children who didn't care much for interesting plots or an exciting writing style.",0,143

"save yourself some heart-ache, get 1200's: after 8 years of owning technics 1210 mkii's without one problem i came to the usa and bought a pair of ttx's because of the favourable price ($300 each) and the extra pitch control,key lock, and adjustable start/stop were all great features.they were good turntables for 2 years. i liked the extra features. the overall feel wasn't bad either, not as good quality as the techics but not a horrible feeling turntable by any rate. after 2 years one of them is starting to die. when i push the start button the platter doesn't ""catch"" and i have to give it a manual push to ""lock"" it on to the motor.i'm now looking for a second hand pair of technics like i should have from the begining and saved myself some money, time, and effort. to anyone looking at buying turntables save yourself the heart-ache, 1200's will last you for ever and you can grow old and attached to your trusty, simple, working, technics.i will really miss the extra pitch control though!",0,178

"poor debut: a preposterous tale that can only be excused by the fact that it was the author's apprentice work, obviously to sayers and christie. the situation is wholly generic: murder done under cover of `the murder game,' and all the suspects have cast-iron alibis. the murderer's is clever rather than convincing, but even this is undone by the complete absence of clues. it is not, however, the central murder that damns the novel, but the sheer badness of the extraneous elements. the facetiousness is embarrassing: alleyn and bathgate are at the nadir of their ingenuousness, giggling coyly like a pair of schoolgirls, while the passages with grubby brats are irritating in the extreme. the final straw is the intrusive and irrelevant ""russian element,"" which badly dates the tale; indeed, the preposterous bratsvo-torture scenes are reminiscent of walling and wallace at their worst. the previous owner showed his disappointment by scribbling cyrillics in the margins.",0,155

"the cinematic equivalent of lobotomy: imagine a power drill making a high-pitched whine as it bores through your forehead.you can hear the pitch shift as the drill bit slows down when it hits the tough frontal bone. at this point, you want to beg your tormentor to stab your ear drums out, just so that you won't have to hear the sickening whine. but you don't. you know that doing so would make the dreadful sound conducted through your skull only more prominent.all thought processes are interrupted as you hear the hot drill bit sizzle into your frontal lobe. that's when your pupils roll, scraping the top of the ocular cavity. your tongue slides out of the corner of your mouth as your jaw comes unhinged. technically, you aren't dead, but then you aren't really alive either.being forced to watch rockstar is pretty much the same - only more painful.",0,150

terrible: i bought this for my son's middle school locker. it worked in our home. we both opened it. he put it into his backpack and went to school. it would not open. i thought he was goofy and insisted he bring it home. he was right. locked tight. unfortunately i had thrown away the packaging and the garbage man had picked it up already. never again,0,67

do not buy.: i accidentally ruined my father's old baking stone so i bought this on for him to replace it. everything sticks to it! we thought maybe it just needed to be seasoned a bit before it stopped sticking. we've had it for over a month and we use it at least four times a week and it continues to make a mess out of anything we bake on it. that's not even the worst of it. it puts out a disgusting smell in the oven. just last night we used it and had to sit it in the garage and open up the entire house because we all had headaches and our eyes burned from whatever fumes it was releasing. i definitely do not recommend this item.,0,129

"disappointed: it took a total of one apple (cut into 8 slices so as to fit in the small chute) and an equal quantity of grapes to derail this juicer. upon my first use, i made an entirely yummy 8 oz glass of apple-grape juice without any trouble. i then switched the juicer to off and handed out a few dixie-cups-of-deliciousness to family members. still quite thirsty, i prepared some carrot and cucumbers for another round and discovered that the juicer would not turn on. i tried pressing the trip switch. i tried cleaning every part of the juicer. i tried waiting a few minutes, waiting an hour, waiting a few hours, and i tried it again the next day.it seems the motor had inexplicably died.the omega 02 was returned the following day.i have to say, it was an extremely cute, seemingly sturdy machine and very easy to clean.its inability to function after the extraction of a single glass of juice was therefore fairly disappointing.",0,165

"don't bother: don't bother. watch something else.i was surprised since several friends told me i had to watch it, but this movie is one of the lamest, uninspired and shallow movies i've seen in some time. its stupidity is only rivaled by ""i heart huckabees."" oh yeah, and its not funny. not one bit. everything that's supposed to be funny is based on overused cliches and cheap ""wacky"" shock value.whatever happened to well-made high school movies that were actually funny and clever but also with some kind of underlying social commentary?

"a little too geasy and the pump got to be improved: my husband is able to find a suitable moisturizing cream for his eczema condition from aveeno, so it leads me wanting to find a facial moisturizer for myself.after reading a few aveeno product review, i picked clear complexion, hoping it is non-oily and will improve my occassional acne problems as well.this is my review after 1 week of trial. i have combination skin (mainly oily around the t-zone area) staying in a topical country. it is a little too oily for me, and the pump size is a little too big, each pump is way too much for my face and i practically have to apply the excess onto my husband.i haven't yet to see obvious improvement on my complexion yet, but i'm still hoping it will show me some results. it is a little too oily for day use, perhaps i will continue to use it as night cream. i think i have to keep my product search going again.",0,172

"beware!!! you don't own books you purchase: i was thinking about getting a kindle until amazon decided to delete purchased books from kindle devices that users had purchased without warning. that the book was 1984 is beyond ironic. now amazon says that they cross their heart and hope to die and stick a needle in their eye won't ever do this again. i also promise that i will never ever buy a kindle from amazon. who knew that whispernet was just another way to monitor users and subject you to the arbitrary whim on whether you really own what you buy. i want to spend $300 on that. oh wait, can they take the device back too?",0,117
"perhaps i am dense, but ...: it seems as though the central claim of chalmers is based on what seems to be a faulty argument. he imagines a molecule-for-molecule identical copy of himself that lacks conscious experience, and then says that because it's logically possible to imagine it, there must be something other than molecules responsible. my problem is that he is jumping the gun. we don't know the brain well enough yet. he is taking an unsolved problem, imagining someone without this feature, then saying that this feature is therefore above the physical. despite his dismissals of the wait-and-see attitude, i recommend we all do just that when it comes to conscious phenomena.",0,114

"unbeleivably unrealistic, hard to sit through...: i couldn't watch this all the way thru straight. i had to stop it sever times and take a break from the boredom. 1st of all it is soooo farfetched. 2nd of all i think hackman shows in this film that he's played one bad guy too many, by his lack of perfomrance, he needs to try some other role. hackman's bad guy acting in this film would be more suitable in a james bond film, petting a white can, while talking about taking over the world. in any case the lead guy is boring, and come on now hidden cameras set upo everywhere to select a jurer? and 20 people at evil hackman's service night and day. this is so unbelievable, not even an artistic film. don't waste your time. only the 1st two minutes of the film is exciting, and it's downhill, the rest of the way. omly for hackman diehard fans who want to see him hige an uninspired performance, playing his millionth roll as an evil genious gone over the top.",0,181

"i,m panning this pan: after over 50 uses, i am finally tired of this pan's flaws and am going to buy a better, albeit more expensive, springform. i make fruit tortes in the pan, and although the batter is very thick, it invariably leaks a lot. i have to put a baking pan under the springform or have a very messy oven. plus i lose a lot of batter out the bottom. i have tried lining the pan with foil, which prevents the leaks, but makes for a somewhat mushy cake bottom. even with nothing in the pan, you can see it does not have a great seal. also, it is a pain to clean, as the batter cooks into the ridge around the base(where the sides sit), and you have to scrape it out with a fine-bladed knife or spatula. cake doesn't slip readily from the base, so you have to serve the cake on the base, which is not only unattractive, but is non-stick, so you have to be really careful if you are using a metal cake cutter. this pan is definitely not worth the money.",0,189
"historically inaccurate: i used to love this movie. i think all of the acting is excellent, and that it perfectly portrays the suburban ennui of connecticut in the 1970s that, albeit in a different form, still exists to this day. my complaint is this: i searched for ""weather in new canaan, connecticut, november 23, 1973"" in wolfram alpha recently (novemebr 23 being the date of the titular ice storm) and the result i got was -- are you ready for this? -- ""temperature average: 48 f, conditions: fog, overcast, cloudy, partly cloudy, few clouds, clear."" that, my friends, is a far cry from an ice storm. it is sad to see a movie go so far in recreating a historical period -- costumes, watergate hearings, houses, even waterbeds -- and get this one crucial piece so very wrong. for shame, rick moody and ang lee!",0,145
"predictable, dumb and moronic: i can't believe a star of lea thompson's caliber or such a controversial comic like andrew dice clay would agree to star in this film. it tries to make a dark humorous statement about aids in the 80s and fails. dice-clay's character is likeable, but your stereotypical jersey guy, and i can't believe he agreed to recite such idiotic lines.while the beginning of the film is ok, it quickly disintegrates into mindless dribble. i get this impression this film was targeted at the adolescent male audience, with lots of sex and some nudity thrown in for good measure. predictable and formulaic, this tacky little film is not worth your money. what a shame that the talented cast of this film had to utter such stupid, inane dialogue. how amazing that such a ridiculous, badly written script was made into a movie.",0,145
"dissapoint is not enough word to say...: let's face it. for all of us who loved 80's heavy meatal this album shows that this guy tramp just wanted to use ...the ""white lion"" name once more (last time, i pray!). it means just: keep of drinking that good ol' fresh water. his other solo works can be as good as he may want (undoubtly he's a good singer/composer). remember white lion was the ""white"" metal band? (not as white as stryper, but kind of good messages: positive, family, mankind, liberty, freedom, bla, bla) whith the lions' skull, this cd tries to get as ""grotesque"" as other bands, far from that feelin' they always were sending to their fans. well, who knows? maybe it's the symbol of the definitive white lion's death. one minute of silence...p.s. vito where are you?for all of us who saw in you a really guitar inspiration is so hard not having your steinberger's sound. at least we have vai and satriani, but miss you a lot, because halen's not out there either!",0,176

"who engages in mind control?: while appropriate medical care has its place, there is very little of it being dispensed these days. once a noble profession, the practice of medicine has become a highly marketed industry consisting of the combined forces of the pharmaceutical companies and the media. mind control is the aim, and today's doctors are subject to these influences. ""diseases"" are being created where none exist to promote the industry, and a deadly industry it can be.christian science and spiritual healing, in my opinion, are far less likely to do harm, and doing no harm was the original committment of the physician. my personal choice is to consider spiritual healing the first resort, and the medical industry as the last resort - and in that case, proceeding very cautiously.",0,131

"disappointing: disappointing film ... the cinematography was wonderful, the costumes were fantastic. emmy is beautiful and a wonderful actress, but she's not an opera singer. patrick is pretty to look at; too bad he can't act or sing. gerard was perfect i think; great actor, just the right 'edge' to his voice to be convincing. the new orchestrations are lush and just right. i was most impressed with miranda and minnie, and quickly got over the fact that minnie's voice was dubbed for the singing; she's a marvelous comedic actress and has been overlooked for far too long.",0,98
poorly made: i used this product to stream movies from a computer to tv. the product worked great for picture quality but only lasted for 2 uses before the end broke off one of the connectors. hdmi connectors do not reattach so this cable is now worthless. i would recommend spending more to get a better made product. that is what i will now have to do.,0,67

"good idea, but undersized and underpowered.: bought this adapter to work with the koolatron p-20 cooler (/warmer), but unfortunately after 30 minutes of cooling indoors it began to emit a burned resistor smell. and when i picked it up, it was very hot to the touch. not good signs, from my experience.comparing it to my ac-to-dc adapter from igloo, it's much lighter and seems to be under-designed. you can't fool mother nature--increased weight usually means greater power handling capacity. in this case it just isn't there. overheating isn't what i bought it for, either. in contrast, the igloo adapter works endlessly with getting overly hot or giving off a smell. it weighs almost twice as much, too, which seems to be related.save your time and money and get something more capable. you'll be glad you did. amazon has been breathtakingly cooperative in this matter, by the way, at least so far. free return shipping and emailed labels are the way it should be done.",0,164

"i really want to like this book: when i first got this book i loved it. it has tons of practice exercised, it uses the kanji you already know, it has a great formula for learning kanji, blah blah blah. but i could never get over the pronunciations, they are so frustrating. i can't tell you how aggravating it is to try and figure out the pronunciation of a kanji when you have to decode the authors pronunciation. and it's not just the ""ti""s being ""chi"", it's the ""tsu""s being ""tu""s, and the ""ji""s being ""zi""s, and the lines over the letters and all of this would have been fine if they just gave the kana next to the pronunciation garble. not to mention the book is 34 years old. i don't want to say this is a bad book because it has a lot of good parts in it but i can't in good conscience give this book a good rating. there are plenty of books out there that do the same thing that are more up to date and a lot less confusing.",0,185

""kiss of the dragon"" is one of hopefully a few mistakes that li will make in his just-beginning career. the film's plot is confusing and, if understood, boring. the film makes no effort what-so-ever in making an actual good story. instead, we jump from fight scene to fight scene dodging huge plot holes and receiving dumb dialogue. the fight scenes are mostly pretty good, especially a random scene where li fights off a troupe of ninjas. but the film lacks interesting characters and bridgette fonda's terrible acting doesn't help the film at all. i like jet li. i know he can do better. hopefully this won't be a big step down in his career.",0,142
very poor install program: if you buy this program be sure your backup files are current. i had all the system requirement as specified but the install program ended abnormally and corrupted my system. i ultimately had to reformat my hard drive and reinstall my operating system and all my other programs. i would give this product zero stars if i could.,0,62
"not one of his best: masterton has written a *lot* of books, of which i've read a few. of those, i'd have to place this one somewhere in the middle.it starts out great, builds on some interesting ideas about the flexibility of time, if you use the right kind of architecture, and keeps your attention and continues to be creepy for about 3/4 of the way. then it seems like masterton gets lazy and relies on some horror cliches that will make anyone who has seen a few horror films groan. one of the characters even thinks to himself that the situation he's in is like the film ""don't look now"". the characters do things like walk around a spooky house separately when they know it's dangerous. that's like a joke out of the first ""scream"" movie! and there are scenes that will remind readers too much of ""the shining"".because this book started out so well, i can rate it higher than masterton's ""basilisk"", but it comes nowhere near the level of ""the hell candidate"" and ""house of bones"", both of which i recommend.",0,184

not very accurate or up to date: i bought this book a few years ago (i have since been hired and am an air traffic controller). the book gives you a vague idea at best of what you will see when you take the test. i would recommend checking sites like stuckmic as opposed to getting this book as they will have more and better information and you can post questions and participate in conversations in the forums if you like. it is also useful to follow the forums to find out when others who applied to your job posting are getting offer letters and such. getting hired is quite a long ordeal so it's nice to know that you aren't the only one waiting months for the next phase of the hiring process.,0,134

"ehhh a big disapointment: i'm a big real time strategy fan, and when i saw that star trek came out with a game that gives me the power to create and command ships in that way,i was excited. when i finally got it it was filled with nothing but disapointments. first you'd think four different races from the galaxy would be different to use no. they're all the same, just a few cheesy special weapons. the ships look great but my opinion they should be a bit larger, i mean i have a hard time finding my scouters they're so small. the missions are very easy, any starcraft veteran as myself can set up a few defenses and rest easy. another problem is destroying your enemy, it takes forever! i've played star trek armada 2 and they're is such a huge difference. graphics are solid though. but i recommend to buy the sequel you get way more ships, which i really dont understand why you get so few in the first.",0,171
"sad sad plot: my mom came across this book at a used book sale, and i couldn't get rid of it quick enough. i would never read this to my children. the story revolves around the tub child who goes down the drain and all the anguish his ""tub family"" experiences after he disappears. eventually he returns, and all is well, but i can't get over the tub mom's horror as she stares down the drain desperately looking for her child. other reviewers are worried about tub phobia? that's the least of my issues. it's just plain sad. okay--a happy ending, but an overall sad story as we see the poor tub child stuck in the pipe bobbing helplessly...the illustrations are appealing so i can see why that might catch a child's eye. it doesn't change the fact that the story is too distressing.",0,144

curses!: this movie would have had a chance if wynona ryder wasn't in it. it still astonishes me how many movies she has starred in and she is one of the worst actresses and even more astounding she gets roles that require her to do an accent which is downright laughable hearing her poor abilities with them. the other actors however were quite authentic and passionate with their roles which saved my rating from being 1 star. the story of the movie is boring in itself but i understand it's based on a true story. it was a bit interesting to see the ignorance of those times.,0,107

"lasts awhile -- but when it's wet, it stays wet: i have had 2 or 3 of this bra, and it is pretty supportive (i'm a 36d) and lasts for awhile. but my problem with this bra came up in the summer -- once you are sweaty, the heavy cotton stays wet (and i am not a very sweaty exerciser!). this isn't too big of a deal if you're just doing a 30 minute run then promptly changing your clothes, but if you're going to be exercising for a longer period of time and/or can't change your clothes immediately, it's kind of disgusting and unhygenic to have the sweaty material against your skin.there are other bras that are more supportive and are made of material that wicks away sweat.

""walk away renee"", ""ask the lonely"", and most of the others recorded here just don't hold a candle to the originals. and only in the interest of historical accuracy, to gently correct another reviewer, ""it's in his kiss"" was recorded by betty everett fifteen years before cher did (you could look it up!)like manilow singing sinatra, of the aforementioned bolton singing percy sledge, some things should just not be done.",0,134

"sort of like toy story on qualudes: i can put up with the ages old wisdom of scaring the crap out of kids about the big scary world and the nasty people who live in it, and so what if the falcon is the bad guy and the rodent is the good guy so long as there are no bb guns under the tree, but lets have some fun! this is a kids movie. stuart is sort of likeable and snowball the cat has some good lines, but i only watch this sort of thing because i am sure i will feel good at the end and i ended up thinking this movie would make kids not want to go outside. happy i watched it first.stuart little is a poor stepchild in a genre filled with excellent heartwarming films.(aladdin, lion king, toy story, finding nemo).",0,145
"a slow, tedious read: a friend recommended this book. i do not know why. my opinion: i found it to be a slow, tedious read, mainly because it contains many detailed descriptions about people, settings and situations irrelevant to the story - what i consider ""filler"" and a waste of the reader's time. i think the book could have been much shorter. furthermore, the characters and plot were never believable. a college student helps new friends hide a murder with which he had no involvement, and then helps those friends commit another murder to help ensure the first murder - again, one in which he had no involvement - is not revealed. the author uses her characters to display her knowledge of language and literature. i guess she had to use it for something.no, i've never written a book and i probably never will. and, yes, it's easy to criticize someone else's work. still, i did not enjoy reading this story.",0,161

"not worth it!!!: for one, this product is not the size it's listed as. i bought it for the large 12 x 24 size, but it is only 11 x 20 (the box even says it). does not come with a strap, either, as stated. also, it is very stiff! if you want it say for the back of your neck, it is very uncomfortable because it won't ""wrap"" around your neck. the cover is also very cheap polyester. not worth it at all!",0,84
"direct to the trash can: this movie is so cheap, sickening, offensive, racist, tacky, and without merits that it gives bad movies new standards for comparison. it's not even sexy. possibly the worst movie ever seen and the only vhs that i've bought that has been sent directly to the trash can! trust me, do not waste your money. buy ""billy hollywood's screen kiss"". at least, you won't get sick! one star is given because there are no lower standards given. take one star as a far fetched compliment!",0,89

"very poor quality, low illumination: i bought two of the lamps from the verilux site. one of the lamps had a mismatched screw hole, so the lamp could not stand on the base. instead of returning the whole (heavy) lamp, i had to use my electrical drill to puncture a new hole in the metal so that it could be used as a floor lamp. the other lamp's light bulb stopped working after 3 months of less than 8 hours of use per week. it cost almost $25 per bulb! when i posted my review on their site, it was never published. it is very dishonest for them to only post the good reviews on their site. i suspect that those reviews were posted by the friends and employees of the company.",0,132

"what's so funny?: i found this book not morally complex or sophisticated so much as just plain offensive and cruel. i don't see the point of taking us inside the minds of teens who would even consider such a brutal crime as kidnapping and terrorizing another human being. this has none of the layers and provocative questions of ""lord of the flies."" it was, to me, pointless. most teens i know are interested in cleaner fare, in deep questions about life on other subjects. and despite the predominance of disturbing themes and plots in teen novels, many teens i know look for other books instead; they really aren't that interested in stories of kidnap, rape, incest, suicide, and murder.",0,119
"context is everything: i read this book before frey revealed that it was fiction, and kept thinking, there is no way that this could be true. it did hold my attention, but in that ""truth is stranger than fiction"" way. once you know that it really isn't true, its just a badly written and improbable tale made up by an idiot.",0,61
"kellerman can do better than this.: this ""departure"" from kellerman's usual writing style is not compelling. the dialogue is good, realistic and believable, but to me, the majority of characters were not likable, and their lives seemed ill-conceived and strange. the setting shifts between grim and sleazy. the plot is tedious and the action, slow, even boring. i had to force myself through it, on the off chance that it might get better. i loved kellerman's decker and lazarus series. moon music plods along, and just doesn't work.",0,88

didn't like this at all.: another book club book. we have an artist in our group that was dying to read this. she actually looked up and printed off copies of the paintings that were described in the book. most of our book club liked this. i did not. it was very long and depressing. i appreciated the story and the struggles that the main character went through. i did not find this entertaining but more of an assignment type read.,0,81
"couldn't get into it: while the first 20 or so pages of loraine adams' ""harbor"" had me on the edge of my easy chair, the story seemed to ramble after that and i found it harder and harder to pick up the book. at the start we are enthralled by the story of aziz, an algerian illegal immigrant, as he leaps off the boat he stowed away on and swims to the boston harbor. the tale of his first few days is compelling...after that it seems a miasma of a story of living with characters that we can't really care about. for me, the promise of the beginning was not fulfilled.",0,111

nice design but didn't work for me: i bought this because after using many coleman products over the years when camping i've always been impressed by their brand. but this was a disappointment. it just never held a charge. i emailed coleman and finally received an answer from them -- the day after i had packed it up and posted it for return!

"great white bored to death: the description given by amazon makes this sound like some sort of explosive and exploitative snuff film. its not. its about sharks alright, but also other creatures of the sea. glenn ford is the narrator and does a valiant job, but the material here comes across as one of those films you were forced to watch in science class in high school. one of the nastier, and quite dated, aspects of this documentary is its utter nonsensical portrayal of great white sharks as demons of the sea. they aren't and the lengths at which the documentary goes to explain that is frankly rather disgusting. want to see humans devoured by great white sharks? don't look here. actually what you spend the last half hour witnessing is the needless slaughter of these majestic animals in south africa. it made my blood boil and made me ask ""who are the real monsters in this scenario?"" the filmmakers don't decry this practice but rather belittle the wisdom of conservationists at the time, albeit 1981.",0,176

"don't buy it!!! the black screen got me too!!!: 2 weeks ago our laptop died and because i swore i'd never buy another compaq again, we went with the toshiba on the recommendation of our computer tech. bad idea!! the first day we got it i was on the internet and the screen went black. i figured i must have hit something that set it in hibernation mode so i held down the power button until it shut down and restarted it again. a couple hours later, same thing...the next day, again and so on. i decided to do some research as i was planning on taking it in tomorrow to have it looked at. well, after going on many websites, i have discovered this is happening all over the place. i am not the only one!!! i wish i had read these reviews before i bought mine.needless to say, i am taking this laptop back tomorrow. i am not wasting my time with a company that knows they are selling a product that is flawed and yet they continue to do so.don't buy this computer, you will be sorry!!",0,190
"faulty electronics in a nice design: there have been frequent failures of this mouse of the doa kind. many doa mice do not communicate with their dongle and the logitech reset procedure does not help. it isn't clear whether this problem is a design or a production problem.there have even been many doas of the same kind with so-called refurb mx revolutions recently sold by woot.for details check either logitech's customer blog or woot's.note also that logitech's reset procedure involves six button actions and a switch flip, since there is no reset button on this mouse to reconnect the wireless, a seemingly clear design defect.this is a huge black eye for logitech, heretofore a company held in high respect.",0,119
"russian wife: your greatest blessing or your biggest mistake: it was not the biggest, nonetheless, a mistake in buying this book.i am sending it back not bacause of 8 bucks, but to make a point.it is a very trivial and quite hostile writing ;seems like it is aimed to put down other women (or frogs, as a female co-author calls them). in a view that co-author is ""e-mail bride"" herself, it is very strange to see such aggression towards her russian female compatriots.besides, the insights into the russian culture are quite shallow and trite.in summery, this book was a waist of time and money.",0,104
"definitely not ""outlander"" quality: i really really wanted to like this book, since i love historical novels and the setting should be fascinating. but i couldn't get past the first few chapters due to the author's pedestrian writing style and ho-hum characterizations. i was also constantly put off by anachronistic speech patterns. the publisher wants you to think this is ""outlander in america"" but it's simply not. i've read many a paperback genre romance with more flare and dramatic tension than found in this book.",0,85
"several hundred pages of fluff...: if you have no idea what you're doing get this book. it does a good job of summarizing the apps in sbs. if you want hard core, real-world examples and tips look somewhere else...if i knew where i'd tell ya.",0,45
"not worth the 10 bucks!: virtually every track of this recording is distorted due to what must have been excessive gain during the recording. shame, otherwise a pretty good performance.",0,30
"good & bad points: it looks good once it's together. however, it scratches very easily during assembly. also, one of the top moldings was longer than the other two so it did not fit. so of course, while i was trying to get it between the gable moldings, quite a few scratches were made. i have since e-mailed the manufacturer & requested a replacement part. again, it does look good once assembled once you use the included color marker pen to hide the scratches. but i do not think it is worth the money. maybe about half that.",0,98
"it's a nice paperweight...: i'll keep this short and sweet. i've had the zen xtra 40gb for about a month. i'm returning it tomorrow (hopefully) to get an ipod.pros:- plenty of space- 1/2 the cost of a 40gb ipodcons:- user interface is difficult to use; jog dial isn't very easy to manipulate- poorly designed software (buggy and doesn't work 50% of the time)- eax sound field manipulation is garbage - don't use it- can't use it as an external hard drive w/o extra drivers- bigger than shirt pocket- sync capability is practically useless and error-prone (200 of my files wouldn't sync thru creative's driver)the only redeeming thing about the zen is a third-party shareware product called notmad explorer which is great - but unfortunately it uses the creative driver and the zen itself, so it's not much better.",0,138

"not what i expected: as another review said, i also do not feel some of the messages are very close to traditional taoism.i was hoping for something that would give me a concept to meditate on each day.i wanted to read a passage in the morning that brought up something thought provoking that i could mull on over the day. i only read 5 days (one passage a day) and just felt like it wasn't what i expected. maybe if i had given it more time? but life is too short to force through something you are not enjoying.all i am saying was it wasn't right for me. for you, it may be a different story.i highly recommend the tao of pooh. i felt like that did frequently give me ideas to meditate on (but not in a one-a-day type format of course).",0,143
"yuck!: this movie is disgusting, not uplifting. every adult character is a brutal stereotype, the kids are all hyperactive acting, and the protagonist just stares with a blank look on his face the whole time. i hated it.",0,38

"ugh! this is very bad!: i wouldn't suggest for those who are into yellowcard's ocean avenue (which i am), then don't buy this. if you don't believe then listen to those 30-second samples. i hope their next album is not like this. it seems that in 2 years, they almost lost all their talent. get something else by them-i don't know, just maybe their last two albums. warning: the cd contains explicit language (they forgot to put (explicit lyrics) beside it, i'm serious, i've seen it in stores and it may not be suitables for persons under 16 years of age.)",0,101
"absolutely awful,o stars: this mess of a movie is so absurd and badly acted it looks like a show that comes from the bbc channel and the monster looks like a ape that you see a wax museums.the movie has virtually no plot and the actors were a bunch of unknowns and they couldn't even act there's better acting on power rangers tv shows and the monster is so unrealistic that monster costumes at wal mart look more realistic and scarier than this.the other flaw is that horrible music on the soundtrack.save your time,money,and brain cells because this one should be avoided or better yet smashed with a sledgehammer and then burn the pieces.",0,114

bad product: i knew when i bought it that it was $20 under all the other sites and that should have thrown up warning signs but i still bought it because the other doc product i bought (from a store not online) has been working for 3 years if not more now. but i have had this product less then a month and already the moter is dying and i have to smack it to start moving again. don't buy these they just plan suck if u want something that is going to last go somewhere else.,0,97
"lawrence sanders can do better i hope!!!: unfortunately, for me, i found this latest read of l. sanders to be a complete departure from his usual intriguing writing abilities....i prefer the mcnally series, and hope desparately he comes back...after 18 years of reading all of his releases, i have now invested in hard cover books....guilty pleasures, to me was slow and the ending was poor....after all with today's societal norms on incest i found it very hard to believe this man could get on a boat and sail away from one of life's horrific situations that many children and adults live with....the characters initially had some luster then they became boring and predictable as well...overall i was disappointed with this...after living in florida from 1992 through 1995 i became very aware of the palm beach and florida coast line lifestyles....mr. sanders, there are ions of volumes you could write about the folks down in florida.....thank you...bring back mcnally and hopefully he'll marry consuela!!!",0,163

"very mixed feelings: i am currently reading this book. it is the legend of the house of the seven gables that makes the novel interesting - the curse the house bears and those troubled characters living within neglected walls and shrouding darkness make for an intruiging read. i have to admit, though, that this book is a very heavy read for me. it seems unnecessarily poetic and lacking in action. at times my mind wanders from the words my eyes are habitually tracing across the pages, but there are other times when i am absolutely absorbed. but i'm only absorbed periodically for only about a third of the read, and overall it's just not working for me. i'm driven to the end if only to see what becomes of these odd, cursed beings who are seemingly manipulated through this book by a rather dark destiny.",0,145

"crap!: this game has serious flaws. in my set all of the rush hour cards were the same answer, and it only took the group 5 minuntes to figure it out so we tossed out half of the game. overall it was about exciting as playing war with a deck of cards. i returned it. do not buy it!",0,59
"yeah, but without diane lane . . .: . . . moving around in that red dress, it doesn't quite make it. seriously the two ""fire"" songs are quite good. the last song is your basic rock and roll anthem, big wall of sound, and really great vocals (not lane of course, but she lip syncs with the best of 'em). it's all very dated now.",0,66

not what i expected: products clearly states do not leave plug in for more than 3 hours. if anyone knows anything about battery powered equipment they know that you keep the battery in the charging when not in use. there seems that the product is either designed wrong or just a piece of junk.,0,54
broken: i received this item broken. the manufacturer's box had a clear shot. not in the package from amazon.unfortunately i opened it after the final date for return.,0,28

"don't waste your time: i thought it would be nice to read the book before going to see the movie. however, after reading the book, i do not want to see the movie at all. there are a lot of cheap thrills in the book...the play on bodily functions, while funny, is dull after awhile. duddit's cancer and down's syndrome seem somewhat overly dramatic, like the book is trying too hard. plus, by page 200, i cannot help but feel stupid for reading the book. nothing in the book is fresh or imaginative. the emotions that are supposed to be stirred up are unconvincing and uninspiring. although the plot is interesting enough for me to want to find out what happens at the end, i feel like i wasted a lot of time reading all 600+ pages of it when i finished it. if you are a stephen king fan, this may satisfy you. however, if you are not a fan, don't bother.",0,163
very disapointing: this does not work well with my g4. the online technical support was extremely horrible. i'm not happy that i spent so much and got so little.,0,29
excellent imagery...dumbed down story: i enjoyed this disc. the video is stunning. i agree with others that the story is very dumbed down and takes a childish approach. it actually seems like its a little one sided and very pro-environmental. nevertheless its enjoyable. i would say however that the amazon wmv hd disc is a better story and has better and sharper images and more interesting things to look at.,1,70
"this import is sooooooooooo good: this is a great cd!!!!!!!!! it is the normal oops! cd plus three cool new songs. also there are lots of added extras that are inhansed on the cd, for example you get the lucky video, a fact file, and a britney unscrambler!!!!! the three bonus tracks are really nice but i wish that they could have been a little more up tempo. just to clear something up it says in the discription that there is an exclusive oops preformance but there isn't!",1,88
"amazing, fascinating: this was a stunning book. well written, packed with fascinating detail, i wish i had ten more like it to turn to. anyone looking for an inside view of a part of china's history would do well to pick up this book. it was a wonderful read.",1,49
"great album - some serious stuff: first off, i've bought all of tonis other albums. this one took me three listenings to really get to like it. when i found out that it was about a child being born and how her life progressed, i found the work all the more interesting. some of the songs really stick in your mind. if you see the album as a story (of a girls life) it makes the album much more interesting than just listening to the album song by song.pink floyd used to do this, have an album which was a theme or story, like the wall album.i took the cd out of my colection after not listening to it for about 5 months, and have been playing it in my car on the way to work and home for over a week now.it's great. and i'm not a female by the way.nice album. if you like tonis other works,.....get it.",1,160
"good quality, but high shipping charge: the scratch resistant screen guard protector is fit perfectly on the screen of htc cingular 8125. quality of the screen guard protector is very good. only negative point is high shipping charge. it cost me $4.99 as shipping for buying this item which cost $ 3.49 amazon has to reduce the shipping charge, or reduce the shipping charge for combined items. any way best buy.",1,71
great choice for bedtime or anytime!: we were given this book as a shower gift before our kids were born and i was somewhat skeptical but it has turned out to be a favorite. our daughter loves to name the animals and their sounds and has learned her colours from these wonderful books. the pictures are just right as is the wonderful text that is just enough repetition that she 'gets it' to participate with the reading. a great asset to your children's library... or shower gift for those people who have everything already!,1,94
"fun for all ages!: having received this video as a gift, we watched it as a family, accompanied by a lot of laughter and ""i didn't know that"". the kids managed to show this to most of their friends, the youngest even taking it to school where his 1st grade teacher used it as a part of her unit on careers.the video is an overall winner. anyone, any age, will enjoy the playful and informative story and all will come away with a greater understanding and respect for both the lobster and the lobsterman. buy it!",1,96
contemplating marriage...a must read.: this book is used by many marriage counselors. but i believe if you are getting married this book should be required reading. it provides true insight to what makes us tick and how to keep the fire burning bright which should be every expecting to be couple's heart desire.,1,53
"ran the stoplight?: listened to this cd closely for the first time in a while. i've forgotten how outstanding this cd is. while i have not heard pure, i have ordered it hoping it that will be anything close to this cd - and hopefully far away from dead inside which is a whole different planet. great vocals, great music, great lyrics, it has it all.",1,66
"excelente compilación de lo mejor de caifanes: debido a los otros comentarios al respecto de este disco quiero aclarar que caifanes no es lo mismo que jaguares. son dos grupos diferentes ya que en caifanes la guitarra estaba en primer plano. el unico pero que le pongo a este cd es que solo incluyeron 2 canciones del mtv unplugged. me hubiera gustado que incluyeran todo el mtv unplugged en el segundo disco. las guitarras de marcovich se aprecian mas en las versiones en vivo ya que existe la certeza de que no hay ""overdubbing"" (regrabaciones). un buen disco para empezar. estoy seguro que si este es el primer disco de caifanes que se adquiere pronto nacera la curiosidad por conocer las canciones que no se incluyen de los otros discos.",1,130

"excellently drawn characters: nina's characters are complex and drawn well, it is evident that she took some time to think about her character's motivations. if i were a writer i might have written the ending differently, but that is okay, my book club talked about this one for awhile. a good exploration of the line between admiring someone and stalking and a bold exploration of the dark side of behavior. if you are looked for a well plotted, interesting story, this is for you. it is not one of those books with lots of sex and no plot as you might think at first. i was pleasantly surprised and look forward to whatever ms. foxx has up her sleeve next.",1,120
it's nice: i've saved a lot of space by hanging my shoes up with this. for heavier shoes you have to use more than one hanger though,1,27
"one of the best albums i've owned.: a few years back my father got me hooked on this album. it was the first cd i ever owned. an ex-girlfriend liked it so much that after we broke up she declared that cd was not coming with me.i couldn't blame her. the mix of blues and spirituals with cooder's unique playing makes this one the most intesting albums i own. the medley of ""feeling good"" and ""fool for a cigarette"" is one of my favorites as well as balads like ""mexican divorce"" and ""jesus on the main line"".the album also has some songs that keep it from taking itself too seriously. the song ""if walls could talk"" has a catchy riff and great words.cooder's great acoustic style shines through on what was a break-through album of the time and holds up years later. i always hear something that i missed on previous listenings.although you don't need to be a guitar player to appreciate this album, every acoustic player should hear the fine guitar work. enjoy!",1,174
great for making dough: i ordered this bread machine for a vacation home that we own. i have a cuisinart at my year-round home and it just has too many bells and whistles that i never use - and cost a lot more. the sunbeam makes a great dough and was a great price.,1,54

everyone needs to let it go!: i'm sick of everyone saying ashlee has no talent. if she had no talent she wouldn't have a record deal. she is only 19 and talks about 19 year old things. people seem to forget that she has been on tv for 2 years and that is why people already know her. i appreciate her music b/c it is her music. she's more than many musicians today-she's writing the lyrics rather than singing other people's songs. the album is good. quit putting her down and appreciate her for her hard work! she sings a lot better than other musicians you all like!,1,108
just like when i was a kid!: i bought this for my daughter when she was almost 2yrs. and she loved it from the start. the music is a little annoying but that is my problem not hers. she has stood on top of it and it has been dropped down the stairs and it still works fine!i would definalty reccomend this toy!,1,63
"works great for me: after my last panasonic shaver mysteriously disappeared when i moved across the country, i decided to try this one, since the price was so cheap i wouldn't be kicking myself if the other shaver is rediscovered in a moving box somewhere. i have been very pleased with it, and love shaving in the shower with it. like others, i have found that the neck area requires a little more attention and a few extra passes to get the job done, but well worth it for a close shave with no bleeding. it took over a month for the product to be delivered from amazon, since they were out of stock when i ordered.",1,117
"lost: a friend gave me a copy of ""dresden"" and i watched it many times before giving it back and ordering my own copy. i watched the movie several times for different reasons: 1. history, 2. view from the german side, 3. view from the british side, 4. acting skills. i love the movie, am impressed with f. woll's in the main role. i think some scenes were too hollywood, loved the honesty of the script, not too much violence, but one can start to feel the horror of the bombings and being trapped in cellars and on the ground by the devastating fires. i was a mistake, a big one, history was destroyed as it often is in wars. did the germans deserve this so much emotionally human reaction? yes and no. not only the germans or the people of dresden lost a jewel.",1,145

"yummy!: these are individually wrapped and there are approximately 15 cookies in each box. they have a nice flavor and are fresh and crispy. the fortunes are standard fortune cookie fare. very few of these were broken during shipping. i definitely recommend these if you like fortune cookies. they are a low-calorie, low-fat snack. yummy!",1,55
"great speaker package for the money!: polk audio rm6750 5.1 channel home theater speaker system, black finishi have been using this speaker system for about a year with a sony str-dg810. i am very pleased with the performance of this package especially at the price point. my friends and family have all been impressed remarking that the system sounds like a movie theater. bass from sub-woofer is deep and powerful and the center speaker reproduces dialoge beautifully. what is also nice, polk sells seperate surround speakers so i can make a 6.1 system since my sony receiver has that capability. don't worry if you are thinking about rm6750, i have enjoyed mine from the start!",1,115
"kfm: i first saw kentucky fried movie when i was 17 years old. i am now 51. a friend of mine mentioned a line from the movie and it was so funny that i went online to buy this movie to show my son and also to see it again with my friends now. it is made up of little skits that are all funny. maybe a little silly also, but still a good movie to hang out and watch.",1,80
"funkin amazing and out there: like strayhorn and the duke, gil really found someone he could bounce off in the shape of brian jackson. his earlier stuff is pure gold, but very droney sometimes... but this!!!this i never tire of. the songs still sound so vibrant and fresh.the live version of 'home is where the hatred is' has been sampled by masters @ work, and is a muso's dream to get into.'hello sunday hello road is one of the grooviest tracks around, and you just can fail to move along and understand the message of 'it's your world.' my mum used to have the lp, secrets, with the cats face on the cover. angel dust is a spacey reincarnation of whats it's like to trip out on the stuff, and the lyrics to showbusiness are more relevent today than ever before.this is one of the best and most valuble compilations of gils to come out, and is an essential purchase for and funkster and poet.",1,165

"amazing first single!!!: the first single from this album is called ""through the rain"". it's like old mariah only even better. this is a beautiful ballad which has a similiar theme to ""hero"" or ""can't take that away"", but is even more incredible. if you liked ""old"" mariah, you will want this album. she does have rappers on it, but they aren't the main focus. it's such a beatiful song and i have heard soooooooooo many good things about this album ~ and not just from fans but from critics too! go to her official site to listen to through the rain http://www.mariahcarey.com",1,103
"my dog's favorite toy by far!: i bought the duck for my 5 pound poodle and it became his favorite toy. the sound of the duck scared him though, but the great part is if they don't like it you can just remove it and they still love just the plush toy. it's perfect for even the smallest dogs and can easily be carried around and played with. the design makes it easy for small dogs to get their mouths around to pick up. i would not recommend this for very destructive dogs though as the limbs might get torn off.",1,101
"it's the unthinkable!: the only reason that i am giving 4 stars is because the author did not list all the victims of dr. shipman's unsuspected reign of terror in lancashire. in his long career, he probably killed at least 200 victims--men, women, children, for no apparent reason until he was stopped by the law. sadly, i cannot stop thinking about all the victims who had dreams to see israel, cruise, grow up, or old with their loved ones in lancashire. dr. shipman was supposed to be respected and trusted with their lives; he killed his beloved patients without such motives at all. the book is an easy read unless you're trying to find out the victims and give them a proper memorial. this book is for those victims and their families! maybe we can learn from what happened in lancashire!",1,141

"very helpful.: i ordered this to accompany the pimsleur language russian program, as pimsleur, although very powerful for learning to speak, has little more than a pamphlet to teach you to read. so, i picked this up, and it is very handy. it has made the process of learning to read fairly easay and enjoyable.i would have rated this a 3, however, because you lose a lot of the meat of the book if you don't have the audio recordings, which aren't included in the book. at least, they weren't with mine. however, i poked around online and found that they're available for download off this website:http://mllc.utsa.edu/troika/student/mp3.htmi don't know how long that site will be up, but if you intend to use this book to teach yourself to read and speak, those mp3s will be invaluable.",1,136
"i like it!!!: i love the compactness of this waterpik. i had the larger one and this one is far more convenient. you don't have to invert the reservoir and the power of the jet is actually stronger than the bigger model. granted, the smaller amount of liquid in the reservoir was a little disappointing, but i just keep another cup ready to refill it while i am still using the pik. it is definitely easy to use and, of course, that means it will be used more often and the check ups at the dentist attest to the positive impact it has. i most often use a salt & warm water solution and it works great.",1,117

"essential utility: i use this on a jornada 525, and i must say you really need that if you want to avoid scrapes on you handheld.but it is not so easy to assemble without making fngerprints on the display (i started using gloves for that). also the instruction are not so clear. there would be some words helpful.and they are a little to expensive for my taste.",1,67
for movie lovers: i love this game. i play it with my family all the time. since we watch alot of movies together we have alot of fun playing. some of the questions are really challenging so it makes us think harder. now we pay closer attention to the movies we watch so we'll be better the next time we play movie mania. it's really a fun game!,1,68

"fabulous tales with a twist: i first read ""the lottery"" in high school and it has stayed with me ever since. i bought this book for the title story, and it is the most powerful of the stories, though the others are also very entertaining. hopefully it will also stay with you.ms jackson is a phenomenally talented writer. you know immediately that there is something wrong with the simple village lottery, and the suspense and horror builds with every word. that this can be achieved in the space of a short story is amazing - we have a very lttle time before we are faced with the shocking truth.""the lottery"" is the finest short story of its genre, and stands alone as one of the greatest stories ever written. shirley jackson is a master, and her novels ""the haunting of hill house"" and ""we have always lived in the castle"" are also engrossing reads. but ""the lottery""? well, you will never forget the twist in the tale.",1,167
"michael swango, aka killer: good book. very interesting. michael swango - guilty of all charges including murder. i am appalled by what he got away with in the medical field. i am appalled that the doctors and hospitals allowed him to get away with it, and they should have been the ones to 'blow the whistle' on him. unbelievable! i didn't think this could ever happen in the united states and in the medical field.",1,75

"pretty good, hard at first: i bought this a while ago and im rather pleased with it. it works good as a cd player and it never has skipped on me. the mp3 cds can hold ver 100 songs and are very cool!!!! un fortunatly, some of my mp3 files didn't play through the cd player, and some didnt even show up on the display. it is kind of difficult to make a cd and get it formatted right. several of the cds i made didnt work at all, and it took several tries to get my first mp3 cd working, but once i did it was very usefull. the text search feature is kind of cool but i never use it. when u can get an mp3 cd to work it is very cool but it is kind of hard. rthe manual sucks. the cd player is kind of bulky so i wouldnt try jogging with it. but most mp3 cd players are pretty big. it gets scratched easily so watch out. but overall it is very good.",1,179

"l.o.d. - def squad: keith murray steps out for another dictionary rhyme book tales with another album entitled enigma. he impressively both used a vocabulary to conversant with scholars and entertained his listeners with tales of adventure with titles like ""world be free"" and the heartfelt ""to my mans"" featuring dave hollister. as he begins by antagonizing others on ""intro"" it continues over to ""call my name"" as he dares any competition to contest. ""dangerous ground"" featuring 50 grand is more upbeat than usual for keith, but his ability to adapt nearly passes by. the highlight of this lp is ""what a feelin'"" with its groovy, scale runs with the bass. ""love l.o.d."" featuring 50 grand & kel-vicious is a good display of patience and the tight knit of l.o.d. as the trio shows why they are the nicest in this profession. to close, keith murray's enigma is lyrically fulfilling.",1,150
"a decent phrase book, but no more.: i spoke azeri relatively well once and decided to pick up this little book to revisit the language. out of the limited amount of literature on the subject i chose this one on a hunch and it's nothing more than a phrase book for a tourist to get around. it does a good job of indroducing the most common expressions to an english speaker. expect to find exact pronounciation of singlular words and 2-3 word phrases and expressions. do not expect a textbook on the language :)",1,94

"like nothing else...: except maybe jeanette winterson's ""written on the body."" i felt deeply pulled in by this novel, which unfolds slowly and bathes you in an incredibly intoxicating, emotional mist. it is highly erotic and engrossing, and one of the only well written and overtly bisexual works of fiction. the only failure here is the ending which becomes a little too melodramatic and (i think) untrue to at least one of the characters. but the quality of language, plot, and character are very, very high. i took it in while i was recovering from a break-up and the relationships in searle's book were enough to distract me. i consider it my rebound (without the consequences). please read this book.",1,120
"possibly the best tv show ever: i just finished watching six feet under on bravo. all i can say is, thank god for bravo replaying the series! i never watched it while it was on hbo but now that i have a dvr i made sure to dvr the entire series. i just watched the final episode last night. i cannot tell you how much this series touched me. it really gave me insights into both life and death. i grew to love the characters and could identify with a lot of things about them. they made me look at my own life in a new way.the final three episodes are the best three episodes of any tv show, ever. i seriously spent almost the entire last three episodes crying. they were so wonderful and i loved the ending of the very last episode. as stated by previous commenters, it was the best ending of a series ever! i want to own this dvd set just so i can watch the last three episodes again and again. i highly recommend this dvd and the entire series!",1,186

"the ambiguity of genius: laura nyro was a gifted song writer and i loved the sound of her voice. if she was guilty of suicidal screeching, as has been suggested by some, what does that say about every other over paid rock diva? but honestly, this album has always left me a bit chilled. the landscape is bleak. there is a good groove going on lucky, i never understood 'dig those potatoes.' i wish i could have been there to talk her out of that line. timer has wonderful potential, but oh that introduction. the recording of sweet blindness, endearing song, is a mess. there are under-appreciated gems here, december's boudoir and the confession. don't dismiss this album out of hand, no artist could make a more penetrating statement about urban life. some say it took them years to ""get"" laura nyro. she grabbed me on my first hearing as a young teen-ager and never let go. if there is a more gifted singer-song writer out there, i don't know who it is.",1,173

"an exception to the rule...: ...that self titled albums are a band's best. while this album is by no means poor, there is certainly nothing fundamentally wrong with it, it does not compare to their debut ""up the bracket"". however, the album is built on the strained relationship between the creative core of the band, pete doherty and carl bart. this tense writing style is epitomised by the album's flagship song, ""can't stand me now"".i think that while this record is definitely worthy of any self respecting collection, if i could only buy one libertines' album, this would not be it.",1,101

"works fine, auto shut-off a big plus: this coffeemaker works well. it is inexpensive, easy to fill, easy to clean and fairly fast. the only minor drawback is the lack of an externally visible fill level. the internal fill mark is just about impossible to see, so you really have to measure the water you put in. the automatic shut-off is a big plus. i previously had a similar toastess model (toastess tfc-326 personal-size 1-cup coffeemaker, black) which was also a good coffeemaker. it had an external fill indicator, but it lacked the automatic shut-off. i kept forgetting to turn it off after making coffee, which probably contributed to its early demise.",1,112

"captivating true story but drawn out: the story line of this book is phenomenal. i started thinking it was going to be a quick read because the sample was hard to put down. the authors are very descriptive and there are very little grammatical errors. but, i started to get a little bored about 60% through. the detailing started to seem drawn out and it was difficult for me to finish. the build up to the conclusion was predictable ( in my opinion) which made it even more difficult to finish. i would still recommend the book to anyone who is looking for a detailed and highly researched account of what happened in juarez during the span of murders.",1,119
"very good, although a coupla very famous and popular sketches were omitted from this collection: not a bad compilation, even though the opera singer sketch and a coupla other oft-played sketches were somehow omitted. very old clips were still enjoyed -- there were more of them than in more recent years, which were usually in color (from tv guest shots or from concerts).",1,63

"evil power pop majesty...: on their debut album, cheap trick's masterful pop hooks were cut with a nasty metallic edge that quickly got sanded down on subsequent releases. rick nielsen's guitar crackles with a palpable electricity, and the sparse production refuses to add gloss or tidy up in any way. the vocal melodies are beatlesque in the best sense, made all the more impressive by robin zander's uncanny ability to sing like both lennon and mccartney. there's an adult malevolence at work here that is completely at odds with the harmless cartoon the band became. forget the power pop bliss they're known for, because on this album cheap trick were aiming to rock.",1,113
"""hits the mark"" rj maccurry, author of ""fallen angels"": ""strength and honor: the life of dolly madison"" by richard (...) cote is excellent reading and a work of art. mr. cote has once again shown that he is one of the best writers of our era. his work continues to excel and there is no limit to his artistic ability to dazzel the reader with his painting of history with a flair that only his author's brush can make. this is another masterpiece that hangs well beside ""mary's world"" and ""theodosia burr alston""",1,93

"a highly detailed look at honda motorcycle history: many books on motorcycles abound with glossy pictures but contain little facts. this slim volume by roland brown is quite the reverse. the majority of photos are original b&ws, not staged fashion shots, and there is ample text. it is not a coffee table book, it is a real book! the history begins with soichiro honda's start after wwii and traces the company's progress to 1989. for the real motorcyclist there is plenty of technical detail which is used to show the evolution from one machine to the next, rather than being just tabulated facts. the story of the development of motorcycles, as we now know them, and the fascinating saga of a multinational company's growth, make excellent reading. my only complaint is that a book this slim (150 small pages), really doesn't warrant a price tag of $25. never the less, i still bought it, and was glad i did.",1,159
"expected more: great concept, fair execution. i expected much more from these discs. most of the tunes on disc 1 are a bit too sparse for my tastes...i was expecting more ""electro"" or ""electroclash"" styles. the juan maclean track is more of an agressive style that i like...too bad the rest isn't in this same vein.i mainly bought this for disc 2. many classics i have on vinyl and i wanted to see how this guy handled the mix...doesn't really come through. the bigod 20 track is actually ""body to body"" and not ""the bog"". the second front 242 track is pitched up significantly...i would have worked it into the mix elsewhere. these cds were mixed on native instrument's tracktor software, with which i'm unfamiliar...maybe that has something to do with the odd style of mixing.overall this is a nice addition to anyone's dj mixed cd collection...good, not great.",1,149

"excellent book on this complex person: i am shocked there are not more books about the personal life of this interesting person in history. this book gives a very good picture of philip ii and the forces that shaped him and the religion that governed every aspect of his life, loves and holy causes. because of his long reign, and dealings with all the important persons of the 16th century, his personal attitudes shaped so much by his childhood, influenced the political, social and religious tide of that time. the conquests of lands in the name of god, influences the geography and history of today",1,105

"demons in russia: possessed is the first book to examine the phenomenon of demon possession in russia. drawing upon a wide range of sources--religious, psychiatric, ethnographic, and literary--worobec looks at klikushestvo over a broad span of time but focuses mainly on the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when all of russian society felt the pressure of modernization.",1,57
"last good local h cd for a long while.: the third of the local h cd's, this one was the best of the bunch. it would have been a larger selling cd if it was promoted by the company the way it should have been.this is the last local h cd where joe daniels is on the drums. joe left shortly after & a new guy came in who doesn't have joe's talent.",1,73

attractive and convenient.: better than a smelly pan sitting on the counter. with the liners it is easy to take to the backyard composter.,1,24
"few details on con's and consistent warnings that you will be caught: i liked the book, although i was looking for a much more in depth treatment of the subject. the author consistently stresses that if you choose to be a con artist you will be caught and exhibits some frustration that con artists are not punished more severly than they are, since most con artist crimes are perceived as crimes the victims brought on themselves through their own greed and avarice.the title is somewhat misleading. don't read this is you want to actually be a con artist as you won't learn too many tricks. there is a detailed explanation on how to short change someone, which i found interesting, but most other con artist tricks are given vague explanations.if you want to know about con artists read this as part of a more extensive study as it does not stand on its own as a resource.",1,157

"classic religious terms are explained in ordinary language: this book contains two memorable stories. the first deals with being a member of the body of christ even when you don't care for the other person sharing your pew. and there is a memorable answer to the question,"" what can one do if one finds it impossible to affirm certain tenets of the creed?""",1,63
"dogs love it!: my two terrier mixes (20 and 30 lbs., respectively) absolutely adore their new ruffians octopus. the smaller dog has a little trouble gripping this size, but the larger especially loves tossing and squeaking her new favorite possession (sometimes to noisy excess). best of all, neither dog's aggressive chewing appears to have made a dent in more than two weeks.highly recommended. great fetch item.",1,66

"i didn't believe you. it works!: i saw this product in a pet store and decided to go online to read the online reviews of the product before i actually bought it. all the reviews were surprisingly positive so i figured i'd try it - why not? at least, i could listen to it and relax even if the animals didn't. well! my two dogs (a shep mix and an akita mix) and the two cats were actually listening and then they went to sleep! it really did calm them down!",1,91
"best -and only- book of its kind: it's an enormous improvement from the second edition, which i also own a copy of. the book covers everything you need to know to pass state and national board examinations and become a licensed dispensing optician. my only complaints are that its contents are ordered somewhat counterintuitively, and that it's a very large, heavy volume (i have enough to tote around with my tools!)",1,71
"better than the movie: hampton sides' telling of the rescue of 500 pows, survivors of the infamous bataan death march, by u.s. army rangers in the philippines during the waning days of world war ii is an outstanding job of reportage. sides tells the story from the eyes of the rescued and their rescuers, building suspense that wasn't always present in the the great raid, the film adaptation of his story. as a working journalist for more than 30 years, i know i good story when i read one, and this one falls into that category.",1,96

"fantastic: fantastic shredder. i've had others that granted, were cheaper, and they were total junk. this one is flawless. you don't have to position the paper just so in the slot, like with my last junky shredder. it's a little bigger, size-wise, than others, but worth it for how it easily chews up a whole envelope full of junk mail.",1,60
"great show!!: this show is colorful and easy to follow for small children. the lessons are simple and an example of good values which is rare these days on television with all of the mindless, worthless cartoons out there. my son loves it and laughs with the characters, i feel good because he is also getting a good lesson! i have recommended this to all of my friends with young children.",1,71

"good book.... although not without flaws...: as non-biased reader (no scottish roots or ties), i found this a good book. its coverage of the scottish enlightenment is excellent - and this is the best part of the book. he covers both the individuals and their theories very well and its highly readable. however, after he moves on from the enlightenment, it becomes quite tenuous. claiming the scots were responsible for the british empire, america and canada is a little bit of a stretch? also, this book can be a bit of a heavy read at times.",1,96
"absolutely essential viewing: so if you're a bit like me, you look forward to new year's eve and july 4th...not just for all the fun and festivities (and fireworks on july 4th) but also for the twilight zone marathon on scify. every year i always catch and episode or two that i've never seen before, and catch a few i know by heart, enjoying every second of it.so during the winter months this year i decided to splurge and buy the entire series box set, every episode in original air date order. this is the ultimate twilight zone package for any fan. plus bonuses too many to list, complete with a booklet which gives a quick synopsis of every episode. simply put, you can't do better than this. all struck from the original camera negative and magnetic soundtrack it says right here on the box, and it definitely looks that way on my tv screen.so do yourself a favor, if you're an old fan or new, grab this set and beat those cold winter night blues, you will love it!t",1,180

"great, but missing things.: i thought this movie was wonderful. it was suspenseful and kept you in your seat. the acting was better than the last movie, as some of the lines were kind of cheesy. the only thing is, they left out 3 major events! chloe and buck's wedding, amanda and rayford's wedding, (actually, they never even introduced her!), and most importantly, someones death. but i won't mention whose, for the sake of those who haven't seen the movie, or read the book. i did like this movie. i really did. i just have to wonder why they left these parts out.",1,103
"a very good solo raider entry: ""death's deal"" is a fine entry in the solo raider western novel series. this series of books focused on the character of raider, working alone for the pinkertons after doc weatherbee leaves the agency.most of the plot is taken up with a grueling cattle drive, which brings out the courage and cowardice, good and evil of everybody involved. the major villain is more of a contemporary sociopath than the standard western bad guy.the solo raider books just don't have the quality of the earlier hardin series, but this one is excellent.highly recommended.",1,98
sex & the city meets martha stewart!: this book was a cute short read with some really yummy recipes (the brisket and the chicken were delicious!) and humerous and insightful stories to accompany them. definately worth a read!,1,38

wonderful book full of great information: a wonderful book for the costume jewelry enthusiast. great pictures and fantastic writing. it gave me a great insight on the quality and craftsmanship of unsigned pieces of costume jewelry. i would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in collecting costume jewelry,1,49
"easy read on a complex subject: this book covers great spans of time and geography and illuminates little discussed, but important and interesting, stretches of history. i found it an easy read, despite the complexity and many characters.the only downside is that more detailed maps, and perhaps a timeline, would have been useful.",1,53

"great new band - rossdale still has it!!!: i was a huge fan of bush and now am a fan of institute. it does sound similar to bush, but probably because gavin rossdale writes all the lyrics and sings all the lead vocals. it has a harder edge than bush did, but overall i'm glad its similar.i was sad to see bush break up and am now glad to have another oppotunity to enjoy gavin's incredible voice and interesting lyric style.if you liked bush, you should enjoy this album.",1,89
"an underrated guilty pleasure: although critically slashed upon its release it's actually a broad, very entertaining comedy with many funny sequences and performances. tom hanks and bruce willis are strangely miscast but are by no means bad. de palma's direction is as stylish as ever and the cinematography is quite beautiful. worth seeing for the eye-popping camerawork in opening five minutes alone. had this been an original adaption the critical concensus would have been far better.the dvd offers a nice anamorphic widescreen transfer and no other extras but for the low price it's great.",1,94
"victorinox vs leatherman: i have been a long time user of many tools from both companies and appreciate both of them equally. i mainly purchased this tool because i had not had a leatherman in a long time.another reason for going with this tool is i needed something i could carry in my pocket clipped. my victorinox swisstool spirit doesn't have a clip on it and i'm not one to carry a pouch on my belt just to carry my tool. i have to dress professional at work and having a tool clipped inside my pocket is a little more subtle in my opinion.it has a different feel than my swiss but i can already see how amazing it will be. the swiss is beautiful, well layed out, smooth, and shiny where the leatherman charge tti just looks mean. the blades on the leatherman are wicked and the best they offer. tools are a bit more out of the way but i love the one hand operation blades that i don't get on anything victorinox that i have.",1,178

"undiluted truth, a molotov cocktail -: this book is like a bible for dissidents. i've felt mentally and morally sick working in higher education for close to ten years now and just thought i was crazy. gatto confirms that it is the system itself which is sick and that the people who run it and benefit are not honest and honorable people and one could fairly label them pathological, i'll even label them as pedophiles for raping the minds, spirits and souls of students. it's rare to see a man speak so truthfully and forcefully and passionately about what is missing today; honor, principle, character, creativity, imagination, independence, and dissent. i'm amazed this man hasn't been assassinated for exposing this dirty game. this book goes way beyond the narrow scope of education, he taps into a world view and value system which is heartening for me, he helps me understand why and how the world is so screwed up. this man should run for president in my opinion",1,168
my dog loves: i have a 30 lb terrier mix rescue. i got this 1 year ago and still in one piece. it is hard plastic so if you have ceramic or hardwood floors it is loud. it does take time for the dog to learn how to get food out. it took my dog an hour or so. i would highly recommend. but always supervise dogs with toys especially when it is new.,1,74

nikon tc-e15ed: you'd better have tripod ready when purchased this telescope. it's powerful zoom factor 420 mm(equal 35 mm camera). in order to get a good picture from this telescope you must learn how to control exposure and speed shot. it's an excellent tool for nikon coolpix 5700.,1,48
"opening chapter to what may be the best epic ever.: the only reason i don't give this book four stars is that it takes about 100 pages to get into, quite a bit for a 400-odd page book, until you consider that it is really a ~6500 page epic divided into 20 chapters. this epic is life, neatly set out in black type, and anyone with a life today will appriciate how similar it is to life 200 years ago. a note of caution, though: if you get through those first hundred pages, you may not be able to put these works down until you've read all twenty volumes.",1,109
"the story of the year: this just not any story to do with chickens, it is the story where it disribes the true life of chicken (if the could think and talk). the carecters are so funny the way they talk walk look. i would really recomend this for anybody. if you are depresed for any reson o your are happy watch this movie it is one of the best short movies this year. the only thing wrong about it is that it isn't wallace and gromit but any way it is still a good movie.",1,96

"highly recommended: this recording of the fabulous grand concertos by corelli is one of the best recordings that i own. these concertos should not be taken for granted; they set a precedent for the concerti grossi by handel, geminiani, and many others.i musici employs their impeccable technique, tone, articulation, and dynamics in this recordings. philips held up their part of the deal; the sound quality on the recording is unbelievable. no other recording that i own is as crisp and clean as this recording is. a must buy for fans of baroque music.",1,93

"classicly lovely and great for baby's vision: not only is this a simple, timeless, unisex looking mobile, but it is also great for the development of a baby's vision. whereas some mobiles function moreso to match decor, other mobiles are educational attachments to the crib. keep in mind that pastel colors are not appreciated by infants for months. the panda bear was the first animal seen by my infant b/c of the black and white. the primary colors of blue jean teddy then become noticed. the green gingham pattern on the dog and the softer hued duck were spotted after further development. my baby is now a sitter and she still likes to look at the panda the most. the only con of this mobile is the wind-up music box. i would have preferred a battery-operated one so that it can play as long as i and my baby wanted. but the reasonable price of this mobile as well as the cute look of it made it a great buy. educational baby products don't have to look weird!",1,178

"a great read following the lines of the da vinci code!: this novel was absolutely amazing. it follows in the lines of dan brown's novel, but has a different twist so it makes the two novels different. shoeles is an amazing storyteller with a flair for twists that will keep the reader guessing until the very end of the novel! i highly recommend this novel for anyone who loved the da vinci code and angels and demons!",1,77
"spellbinding but deceptive: perhaps i have become desensitized, but i found the novel to be misleading; cook spends a great deal of time foreshadowing a tragic, haunting event that ends up seeming anticlimactic; i expected something far more sinister. the preview outshines the work itself. i did enjoy reading it, however; cook's style is soft, understated, and utterly mesmerizing, perfect for late night reading. his style flows and drifts into the subconscious; it's alluring prose, even if it leads to a less than riveting conclusion.",1,85

"couple of strange reviews below: i don't think mtv came within fifty miles of this band. a couple of the reviews below make me wonder if somebody's working out a personal grudge...anyway, toreador is a solid, uptempo, melodic indie rock album by one of the many creative northwest bands to find themselves trapped at the tail end of the ""grunge"" era. songs like ""comet"" and ""shiva"" are fun, frenetic numbers with a sardonic undertone. one of the best albums of all time? no, of course not. but a good reminder that the pacific northwest in the 1990s spawned a lot of quality bands that shouldn't be folded into some one-dimensional ""grunge scene."" buy it, put it on when you want to feel energized and sing along a little.",1,128

"very nice, and a good value for money: i have been using these for about an year now, and they are the best ones under $40 that i've owned. here are some plus points:1. very sturdy metal band resulting in a snug fit2. compact enough to be carried around, without loss in the bass! :)just be careful not to open the headphones holding the plastic parts - they may break. the best way is to hold the metal band and pull them apart. a very good buy, and highly recommended.-amarendra",1,90

fun game true to the anime: i played this game years ago on the sega saturn with my cousin's two kids. they were both as in love with the characters and game play as i was. it wasn't the most challenging of games but the humor and cut scenes made it well worth it.we ended up getting into both the anime and manga because of how much we enjoyed the story. its a shame you can't get this game for less money but if you can find it for less definitely get it. it was a great ending for a beloved console. wish i still had this game and my sega saturn.,1,112
wicked widow: i can hardly wait for each new book by amanda quick to be published. am an avid fan. altho this one is not as good as some of her others. ie.mischief--affair still all in all her ladies all lend a breath of fresh air to the regency period. her love scenes are believable and her men are rather nice even when proven that they are not the answer to every maidens prayers. i like it when the bad and really bad guys get their just rewards. also the street children are treated with respect and kindness. all in all a good book.,1,104

"haunting and beautiful: this is my favorite cure album. some people have called this album depressing and morbid, but i love it - it's cathartic! it takes me to another world. how many artists can do that? everything about this work is gorgeous. i can't live without it!",1,48
"this is great american literature at it's finest!: fortunately, fifteen years (or more) ago, i read this book on my own before my english teacher required it... this is not a book that needs to be analysed and charted. it is one that needs to be absorbed, and felt. it does not deserve to be one of those books students hate merely because it's required reading.the characters are as real as books get, the small town one that you might live in now, or your grandparents might have lived in decades ago. the issues - from racism, sibling relationships, and just plain growing up - touch your soul. and it's just plain fun to read.it's a bit of american culture that should be cherished... passed on as the valuable art it is - but to tear it apart with attempts to read into symbolism, or to over analyze it... that nearly denies harper lee the respect she deserves for writing it.",1,161

"art repros worth hanging: the taschen posterbooks are of excellent quality. the six van gogh's given us here, for a very low price, are a nicely representative group. primarily the most impressive factor is the accuracy with which the colors are reproduced. having seen many in person, i am very critical of prints with poor to pathetic truth in color. we like them to the point of hanging all 6 in our home. the images are of the cafe at arles-night, lane with cypresses, one of the sunflowers, one self-portrait, the bridge at langlois and of course, the bedroom at arles.regardless the amount of money you have to spend, definitely buy this little jewel as an adjunct. or if you are tightly budgeted, what a buy!",1,126
"give it a chance: it is confusing for the first few chapters, and i occasionally had to stop and think about the time schemes... but it is incredibly worth it in the end. this is a wonderful love story with, for once, an original concept. it's very well written... i'm surprised this is the author's first book - many of the passages are just so beautifully constructed. sure, there might be a few plot holes, but they are not important. if the reader does not understand some things, it is because the characters don't either; any confusion simply further conveys the essense of henry's feeling that he has little control over his life, and clare's fear that she will lose him.",1,121

what an excellent story.: i read it over the summer after my boyfriend finished it. to be honest there were some things in the story that surprised me. i thought that the story would have been a little different. i thought some things were also unbelievable but nothing off the charts outrageous. it was long but i was glad because it gave me something to look forward to everyday for a long time. i was entertained by this book.,1,79

"raw & inventive: think of this album as a genius engineer building a masterfully powerful machine...out of an erector set. 'selling live water' has powerful, very raw and clangy, beats. sole's voice is that of anger, frustration, and insight, but overall you can really here a guy having fun. he creates incredible lines without using any proper rhyme scheme; his formula is to be dead on with the beats, and at that he is incredible. while sole's rapping skills cannot be argued with, i must say that the beats are the star of the album. of all the hip-hop albums to emerge lately this one is 2nd only to el-p's 'fantastic damage'. exceptional songs include 'da baddest poet', 'salt on everything', and 'plutonium'.",1,123
"an excellent resource that does not bore you to tears: when i ordered the encyclopedia, i resigned myself to slugging through mountains of information and end up ""what did that say again?""well, i am pleased to say that there was the mountain of information and more often than not i knew what it was saying. the definitions in were to the point, crisp and relevant to the times. rev. p. stravinskas had the insight to include information an ordinary catholic needed at 7pm sunday in a mad rush to complete an assignment.where the encyclopedia lost me were in some definitions that were necessarily lengthy. obviously, some white space could have saved me time in re-reading the whole passage. but, with the value of the information included, i believe the encyclopedia is an excellent resource for those of us who are not scholars in the catechism of the catholic church.",1,149
"good read: e. lynn harris never disappoints and he steps up to the plate once again. i loved the story by jerome dickey...the characters kenya and amir were such a great pair. the cafe piel was good...the ending was a bit unrealistic, but the storyline was good. the short story by channing was awful...i could not finish reading it...i did not know where he was going with the story...this story is why i rate the book a 4 and not a five.",1,82

shipping flaw: i was excited to order this for my 10 month old grand son. when i received it i was a bit disappointed. although the toy seems nice and i am sure that he will love it but it is supposed to be a christmas gift. it did not come in its own box. the shipping box is not in the best shape. i have to go find a box to wrap it in. how come in does not have a box of its own. i do not want them to think that i bought a used one!! i have no idea what to do!!!,1,106
"a journey well worth the effort: if you are familiar with the characters harry bosch and terry mccaleb, there is really no mystery here. but, as they say, it's not the destination that is important, but the journey itself. connelly's writing is fast paced and streamlined. we are not given large doses of non-essential information just to prolong the story, as happens with quite a few other authors these days. we learn a little more about harry but he remains a mystery, and that is the hook. a journey well worth the effort.",1,93
"loved it.: i couldn't wait to see how it ended. (to me, it was more a book where i wanted to know how it ended, rather than just drinking in the current part of the story - it really pulled me along). once it did, i'm sorry that it's over. it's in my head now - i keep thinking i can go pick up my book and read, then i remember i finished it, and my heart sinks a little each time.",1,82
"great reading: while patton had flaws, and they are clearly presented in this excellently-written biography, i found his story full of high interest and one could not help but feel glad that patton was present when he was on the battlefields where he served. this is an excellent work, well matching the other d'este works i have read: decision in normandy (read 5 july 1992) and fatal decision (read 29 june 2003). patton did heroic things but there is no need to admire his flaws--and that includes his belief that crude and foul language somehow made him a better man and general, and that he thought he knew more about mental damage than doctors. but this is a great and enjoyable book to read and i revelled in it.",1,129

"crazy for breakfast club: this movie arrived quick. which is always a good thing. i hate when it takes forever for a movie or purchase to get to my mail box. when i bought it used i was afraid that it would come with scratches and would skip certain scenes, so i would have appreciated it if i had known if it was going to have several scratches. other than that it has been a very good purchase and i am pleased with the product.",1,85
"a wonderful, over-looked sleeper: although the story is about famous z-writer/director edward d. wood jr. and his many mishaps while trying to become a well-received mainstream filmmaker, the heart of the story is the touching friendship between ed and bela lugosi.excellently acted, written, directed, photographed, and scored, tim burton's ed wood is certainly the auteur's best, personal works next to vincent and edward scissorhands: all the stories of misunderstood outsiders.martin landau's oscar-winning, scene stealing bela lugosi is not to be missed:pull the string! pull the string!",1,86
"one of those books that's stayed with me: i read this book shortly after it came out 14 years ago, and it's stuck with me all these years. i won't say its the greatest book i've ever read - there were definately some slow points and characters that seemed to be a bit too odd or maybe even unnecessary - but it is definately a very good book, one i would recommend to anyone looking for some nice escapist fiction that can get you thinking in unusual ways. it offers some very nice twists and turns and was quite and enjoyable ride. it's not every book i remember 14 years after first reading it.",1,114
"good, but consider lilly is better: i truly enjoyed this book, but their second book is better. while i agree that i would like emily to be a little more ""forceful"" in the book, i believe it truly depicts some of the struggles a young, christian woman would have in nyc. i found it funny and inspiring. i would recommend it as a gift for any young, christian woman who is going off to college or life after college. asks some good questions, that are not always easy to answer!",1,90

"a barbarian's love story: irony, agony, and love are the major elements in peter hargitai's novel, atilla: a barbarian's love story. atilla's struggle to free himself from the shackles of the past customs is an emotional rollercoaster.his post-modern fiction would be appreciated by generations who find themselves agonized by people's rejections of the joining of multicultural societies. some may criticize the novel for the ordinary love story, however, it's what makes it worthy to read. peter hargitai was anything but close-minded about the current ""melting pot"" in america, and this is what the world needs. even if the beginning may not be in sync with the rest of the book, it's a nice sense of hungarian history. despite some technical errors, the overall jist of the novel is enjoyable.",1,129
"you can bring ""who you are"" into the work place.: being a corporate executive i belived i had to be one person in my personal life, and yet another in my work life. this book helped me to realize that was not true.

"an entertaining read: i enjoy everything prison related. not sure why, but i have a total fascination with the world of incarceration. this book was one of many that i enjoyed. written in a simple and easy to read format it is a book that you can read in a day or two and not miss a beat. it is a good account of what life is like on the inside, or rather, what i would imagine it is like. if you enjoy a read about life on the inside, you should pick this one up. enjoy!",1,97
"great gift for girls...and boys: this little book hits the spot for preteen & older readers. it's graphically colorful, with a variety of interesting photos & illustrations; it's written conversationally, yet with enough factual citations to validate the unbelievable, heroic stories; and, it introduces the reader to a cast of amazing female characters mainly unheard of in contemporary american culture.i bought it to send to my grandchildren, but was captivated into reading it myself. i learned a lot.",1,78
"nice but a bit ""watered down"": ""rain"" is a classic pre-censorship movie of the 30's. as usual with this type of film, one must do a fair amount of reading between the lines to get the full story. joan crawford gives a strong performance as sadie thompson, a trollop on the run from the law. walter huston as alfred davidson, a bible thumping, over the top preacher, is sufficiently scary. the rest of the cast puts in fine performances. the cinematography is also exceptionally elegant.the story is a bit watered down from it's somerset maugham original, and some extreme leaps of believability are needed on the part of the audience to accept the denouement. but the story is strong and powerful and surprisingly up-to-date considering it is almost 70 years old. it would seem the religious right has been throwing its muscle around longer than we think.i highly recommend ""rain"", if for no other reason than to see joan crawford in the type of role that made her famous.",1,169
"simply superb dance music !: superb! that's the only word i find to qualify this excellent compilation. once you buy it, stop listening to it becomes impossible. the day it arrived i listened to it three times in a row. i've known only ""i like chopin"" from the 80's, i think no other music from gazebo has been played on radio in brazil during all these years. i simply got astonished because all the other musics from this cd are quite so good as ""i like chopin"". and i finally could get a original version of this classic song, both single edit and the lp version. i only had the remix version from the 90's. i really loved ""wrap the rock"", ""gimmick"", ""for anita"" and ""telephone mama"". although the price of 29 dollars plus shipping and the 60% tax i paid to my country's customs it was completely worthy awhile. thanks for amazon and gazebo for this really enjoyable cd !",1,161
"thank god some people agree with me!: i am so glad there are other people who miss nick fox. i was really surprised when the author decided to kill him out of the series. he and jess were the best couple and i really wished he would have stuck around. i haven't read this book, infact i stopped reading sweet valley university after your not sister so i really have no idea who sam or neil are, but i was happy when i read the reviews of other people that said the author should bring back nick fox.",1,98
"great show - dvd design lacking: if your a firefly fan buy it now. the shows are great, good sound, widescreen (fox never showed'm that way) and lots of the plot arc of makes sense (since fox showed them out of order so things were very strange). the only complaint is the quality of the dvd menus and such. the graphics just have a cheap feel and the selection 'bug' disapears into the background from time to time. not a fatal flaw, but glaring compared to the quality of the shows.the missing espisodes explain alot too - why irna was leaving at the begining of 'objects in space' (my fav) and more of mal and zoe's history. plus of course you get to see a real live alien (or is it.....)enjoy",1,131

perfect diversion- beachside read!: danielle steele writes another diversionary read with a fun happy ever after ending! i love this kind of book for a quick mental getaway. read it in one sitting and think of it as the perfect style writing for women who just need a quick fun pick up. entertaining and fun to read.,1,57
2 years and still going!: i bought this from amazon a couple years ago. it still works great and i enjoy it very much. it is one of my favorite things. seeing those rainbows in the early morning (i have it in an east window) brightens the beginning of the day.i would think these rainbow makers would also be great for people who are bedridden or don't get around much. several elderly people i know have taken great delight in watching the rainbows move about their room.,1,87
"enjoyable read if you can suspend disbelief: i enjoyed this book, but i still like stephen king's the stand better. the main reason is that the characters in swan song did not have enough depth. they were either ""good"" or ""bad."" i would have liked to see some of swan's bad traits and some of alvin's good traits, for example. very few people, if any, are either purely good or purely evil in real life, and i felt that this is where swan song lacked credibility. sometimes i actually felt like cheering for the bad guys because swan was just too sugary sweet. other than that, it was a decent book, worth reading.",1,113
"good headset for your blackberry...but: this is a great headset for your blackberry (i use it on my pearl). sound quality is good enough for music and calls and it actually makes it easier to listen to your phone calls. the microphone isn't great and picks up a lot of wind noise, unlike many of the sound canceling microphones out there.however if you live in california (and possibly other states that require hands free wireless in the car), don't cover both ears while driving as that's could result in a ticket. either only use one earphone of the 2, or use a different headset in the car.",1,107

beats all others: with motor homes (and trucks) that have dual wheels it is critical that tire pressures be kept equal and at the proper psi. the milton s976 is the most accurate gauge i have ever used. its dual head is small enough to fit into the ports in the stainless wheel covers and makes it easy to reach the stem of the inside tire. you might pay a lot more for a gauge but you can't get anything better. the only down side is the size and weight. you won't be carrying it around in your shirt pocket.,1,100

"adorable but difficult to ride: i was lucky enough to find this toy at a garage sale and thought it was the cutest thing i have ever seen, especially when you push the button and the horse whinnies. the only problem is that my two year old does not weigh very much and therefore can't get it to move...i found that you have to put quite a bit of weight on it and then release that weight almost completely to get it to ""ride"" which may be difficult for very young toddlers...this horse may be perfect for a three year old or so though! too cute!",1,106
"great workout shirt: i got this shirt for working out.why i like it:light weightmoisture wickinghas reflective stripes on the back for night/early morning runninghas a good fit/shape.wash and tumble dry, no special treatment needed.had this for a year, i wear it regularly and still is holding together.why i don't like it:white as we all know shows sweat stains eventually on the pits. i should have gotten a different color!",1,69

"old soul....new voice.: a true talent!! a new voice with an old soul, norah jones encompasses everything that can be classy about a contemporary artist. using her sultry voice to create a jazzy feeling to old school covers or creating new classics, this album is a must in most any collection. it makes you want to light and candle and drink a glass of red wine.",1,66
"genuine anthropology: so much anthropology is caught up in the detached scientific method. people don't realize that for all its powers, that science has its limitations. einstein realized that, but many lesser scientists in many fields don't seem to realize that. the author of this volume utilizes science -- to the extent that it works, but he strikes a balance by looking the spiritual aspects of societies from their perspective.native american shamanism without bias. extensively researched, with sources noted. entries include reference to the culture group and/or tribe.",1,88

"hard case crime's first original: so, i picked up the first pair of hard case crime novels (this and block's grifter's game), expecting a good read. let me tell you, brothers and sisters, i more than got it.this is a fast read, a white knuckle story of gangsters, hoods and a femme fatale who all suck the loner/outsider protagonist into a tough underworld. it is a trip to hell.one of the main strengths of the novel is its author's voice, who brings something of a modern sensibility to material that could otherwise be dated. still, the book has a vintage feel to it. the piece works and works well. if you like james ellroy's bop quartet, you'll probably dig this.",1,120
"magnificent adventure story! one of trease's best!: i have long been a fan of geoffrey trease's historical novels, but this is - to my mind - one of the best he's ever written. (my personal list of favorites includes *cue for treason* and *victory at valmy* too.) this is the story of paul, the son of a roman legionnaire in britain, who sets out on a journey to rome, avoiding gangsters along the way, to take a message to the emperor, and try to save an innocent man's life. it has everything: adventure, humor, and a lover's description of rome. this book should not be out of print!",1,108
"four years later--still a winner: i purchased this dutch oven about 4 years ago. we use it several times a month for roasts, soups, stews, etc. (perfect for cochinita pibil). heats quickly and evenly and is easy to clean--even when you neglect to stir the contents and they burn on the bottom. just a boil a little water in the bottom and the stuff lifts off. the only minus we have is that the inside is stained--but that's from the cochinita pibil, which braises in a red achiote sauce. this is at least as good as the other brands at a fraction of the cost. for me, it's a no-brainer!",1,110
thick and creamy....: on the hcg diet and my skin was so itchy due to not being able to use any moisturizers. this product saved me. it doesn't have the greatest scent when you first apply but it quickly goes away and leaves your skin feeling amazing. it's almost like a protective barrier that lasts all day. feels silky smooth. i will definetly purchase again.,1,65
"it's a very good reference.: i'm a dental student studying gross anatomy. usually, students don't have enough skill in disecting the cavador to all stuctures (arteries, muscles, vein, nerves) they've studied. this reference help me improving and completing my lab skill. its pictures are all color. they're all real picture. all structure are all clear. (clean fascia very clearly) some sturctures are dyed so they help you identify and understand it easier.it's the best lab reference book i've ever had.",1,80
"excellent!!: i just finished watching this and came away thinking this was one of the best movies of this type i have ever seen!without going into the storyline...the film has a lot of subtitles since it is mostly chinese speaking. but this only gives you an appreciation for the frustration of the lover who knows little chinese, and of his being part of a charade to fool your lovers aging and ill parents [which includes watching him kiss and marry someone else!]this film brings up all kinds of issues, such as gay acceptance, is lying ever good?, personal responsibility, growing up, abortion, respect, committment....and the wonderful thing is, it doesn't try to answer any of these. you come away sorta happy, kinda sympathetic for everyone, and rather sad that, in the year 2004, going to these sorts of lengths to hide who you really are is not so uncommon in real life!",1,152
"not another fad diet: to all the critiques out there, this is not a fad diet. depriving people of the opportunity to read this book is depriving people of information that can make them healthier. this book does not claim to help you lose ""20 pounds by this summer !!"" it is a health program derived from biblical precepts and adopted to modern life. it has certainly helped me with my digestion problems and has given me the energy that i didn't have before i started with this. yes, organic foods are a bit more expensive and this diet does require a change of lifestyle, but hey...so does cancer and other diseases...so take your pick. it's about how to live healthier and prevent health problems in the future for you and your family.it has helped so many people, that there is a support group/community for ""maker's dieters"". http://makersdietclub.squarespace.com/",1,148
"lotsa de casha: the book is beautiful, the art is great, the message the book conveys is a very good concept for children to adopt; however, it failed to get much attention from my 6-year-old twin granddaughters. after offering to read the book to them several times, i finally gave up trying. they were not interested.in addition, there were several areas i felt were poorly edited.",1,66
"good deal with a great phone: if you're not going to change your plan for 6 months, this is a great deal with any of amazon's mobile phones. you may have to contact at&t to change your plan and features once you have your new phone, but it's a fairly quick procedure. good deal.",1,54

"hostage to war-in the eyes of a prisioner: ""hostage to war"" gives a great understanding of the conditions that the prisions of forced labor camps and concentration camps went through. it is the true story of tatjana wassiljewa, who was 13 years old when the germans separated her from her mother and younger sister. she was sent off to a forced labor camp where she suffered horribly under hitler's vicious rule. she experienced things that are just mind boggling. starvation, illness, and so much more. it shows how hard it was to grow up during world war ii and survive. tatjana was a true survivor and went on to become a teacher during her twentys. it was an interesting book if you would like to learn more about world war ii.",1,131
"they just plain rock: aside from the fact that the riddlin' kids are just all around awsome people (i have a signed drumstick from them!!) the riddlin' kids are kick ass musicians. their music is off the hook and impressed me, i'm not usually a fan of the so called ""pop-punk"" but i think the riddlin kids are more than that, this is definatly an album you want to own, i know i'm glad i do!!!",1,76
"a touching, beautiful book: i will never forget my first experience with this book. i was substitute teaching in a first grade class right before mother's day. i had no idea what i was facing when i had to help the students ""practice"" their presentation of the book for their parents and ended up hiding behind the book with tears in my eyes as the children recited the rhyme. i gave it to my mom and both my grandmothers, one of whom i was privileged to help take care of in her final months. this book deeply resonates with everyone i know who has read it.",1,106
"great for hiring sales people as well!!: not only does this book explain many hunches i've had for decades (like who's full of baloney versus not) but it is also a great tool for recruiting sales people. after reading this i""ve discovered that the most likely successful sales people (for my company) are a) those that come from low income, distressed, or limited financial means rather than b) children of spoiled high income/high consumption families.i just fired someone that fell into the latter category when this book reaffirmeed she was never going to be successful.",1,95
"great book for the rockabilly guitar novice: this book does an excellent job at pacing you from exercise to exercise than into songs that play on what you've learned. although the travis picking style can be difficult to get your head around. i would suggest first taking some basic lessons from a guitar teacher comfortable with the travis style, than get this book.",1,63
"cool.: i bought the cd just for yellowcard's gifts and curses.after hearing through the whole album, i believe this album is towards punk-emo-pop . i do enjoy the 2 suites on this album. i guess some of the ppl may be looking for the song featured in the spidey's trailer. too bad it's not included.my favs would be -gifts and curses- , -who i am- and -ordinary-fans of this few emo and punk bands should get this album.",1,78
"always a recommendation with jack s.: this is another soon to be classic along with ""market wizards"" and ""new market wizards"". the traders in this book are top notched. it shows how you that others can trade consistently and be profitable. trading when you understand the rules isn't being in vegas sitting at the slots. it means being the house at vegas. it gives me something to shoot for in my own trading.",1,73
"music is great: i got this book when i just learned to play the prelude 1 c major, and thought i would look into others later, even though the majority of those preludes and fugues are far beyond my ability to play. since then i have tried to play prelude 2 (i) and prelude 24 (ii) that is extremly beautiful though not easy to play, and i have listened all preludes and some fugues from cd or midi files with this book opened in front of me. i realized how great bach's music is. only complaint is that the cover of the book isn't glued strong enough, which is now seperated from the content pages already after only a short period use. also, the prelude 1 (book i) is probably the correct version, but i have seen from some other books the other version with an extra measure between bar 22 and 23. i now play it with the extra measure since it seems making sense to me.",1,168
"this is the best book i have ever read!!: first of all i would like to say that this book deserves a lot more than just 5 stars. it deserves the whole sky full of stars,.... and then some!i started reading this book for an assignment in 7th grade and had one week to read it. i didn't get it done though but i loved it very much. two years later i found it at a library and decided to start reading it again. i got finished with the whole thing and i don't think i'll ever find a book better than it! it just touched the bottom of my heart and it made me cry when i got to the last chapter of it and i would recomend this book to anyone especially people who don't like reading because this would teach them that there really are totally awesome books out there and i would say that this is the #1 book in the world!!",1,166
"not quite as good....: this is a great cd by a great band, don't get me wrong. it's just after listening to the excellent ""introduction to mayhem"" i expected a little more out of primer 55. still a great buy, and it only cost me $... on the day it came out at best buy! any primer 55 fan should own it, and definitely check out their older one. it kicks ....",1,72

newfie owner: we have a 110 lb newfoundland dog who sheds lots of long hair. this vacuum is great on carpet and hardwood! cleans far better than any vacuum i've tried. only complaint is i need to use scissors to cut long dog hair from rollers about once a week (i use vacuum 1-2x per day).,1,56
enjoyment for all: my 9 year old daughter received the laser tag game for her birthday. she and my 5 year old enjoy it so much that i have to take it away from them almost everyday so that they will do their homework.we are shopping around to purchase another set for christmas and are having trouble finding it.what i like most is that they have to move around and get the exercise that children don't get just sitting playing video games.we live in boston and it is cold here now but that doesn't stop them from asking to go outside everyday to play laser tag!i want to buy the extra set so that their friends can play too. (i don't mind playing either)i bet it will be fantastic to play in the summer months late at night!kpj,1,138

"good singin' good playin"": the amazing rhythm aces third and fourth albums - compiled on this disc - are not the revelations that the first two albums were. that said, the music on this disc is better than 95% of what you will find in any music store - online or otherwise - anywhere in the world.music fans have been waiting for this music for many years. either one of these discs would be worth the price of a cd. to get them on the same disc is hitting the jackpot.the aces blend country, r&b, and soul into a brew so potent that you'll surely find yourself addicted after just a listen or two.this disc is a must buy!",1,119
excellent basic training book: telling ain't training is a well written book that covers the basics of designing and delivering training. i would recommend it to anyone who is becoming part of a training organization.,1,35

george forman model #grp90wgr: this is a great item and the reason i chose it was the removable plates. it is so much easier to clean than the ones that you cant remove the plates.,1,35
"excellent game.: madden 2004 is a great game for the average ea sports fan. there aren't many flaws and madden is great with his commentary. the stadiums are of high detail. the gameplay is great. sometimes it won't load. if you have run a different program before you play it, odds are it won't load either at the beginning or the end. i like the trophy presentation at the end of a victory in the championship game or the super bowl. it's a great game with excellent commentary from madden and al michaels.",1,93
"..........: the movie was good, however not everyone is a fan of nicolas cage so not everyone will enjoy this movie.",1,21
"you're late! this is the demo.: i bought this cd back in february, it was then the dynamite hack demo(it's now mass-produced as a cd by thier label,farm club). my cd does not have any label on it, but it is the same.this cd is great, i stopped listening to it back in late april, but it was in my cd player for over two months! --that's how great it is!",1,71

great product: we had an alert just days after we received our weather radio and it worked great! we intend to take it with us when we travel.,1,28
"simply outstanding: everything in this dvd is wonderful--helen liang's technique is simply top-notch. my only critique is that for those unfamiliar with the snake style, the dvd lacks a step-by-step breakdown of how to execute each phase of the form. some of the techniques and postures are rather complicated, and may require extra time and patience in order to be successfully digested. don't let that be a put-off for getting this video, however; this program is really a delight once you have put in the time and figured out how to dance the dance.",1,94
"finally, the complete set!: the thin cases are a welcome addition when you buy this ""upgrade"" edition. the picture quality of the dvds is top notch. an outstanding collection.",1,29
quite a beginning: disney movies are tough to beat. this collection includes kurt russels debut to his long acting career. a highly recomended collection.,1,24
"it holds yer coffee!: yes, this carafe holds coffee, and does a superb job. but it can also store tea, hot water, soup, hot chocolate, marbles, you name it!i've purchased two of these now. my first one broke (it stopped keeping coffee hot), and the second one is for my wife. she likes to drink that crappy flavored coffee, and i don't want it tainting my italian roast colombian experience.",1,70
"great kitchen!: my 18 month old boy normally has a very short attention span (sound familiar?!), but this kitchen/grill set keeps him actively engaged for quite a while! he loves making me a cup of coffee or grilling a burger for dad.my husband and i put this toy together in about 30-45 minutes. i'm sure it would have been harder with only one person. the instructions say not to use a drill, but we did and it was no problem -- much easier/faster!all of our doors fit fine, maybe we just got lucky? i agree more noises would have been nice, but that's what there imagination is for, right?!i definitely recommend this toy!",1,113
excellent for rv wiring: local stores do not carry white colored wire. red and black are used for auto wiring and are easily found. you need white to properly wire an rv. amazon is an easy source for this wire.,1,40
"remover tool works great!: ordered this to help get contacts out of my eyes. i don't have trouble getting them in, so i haven't used the insertion tool. the little ""tweezers"" are great at picking out the contact after i've slid it down to the outside corner of my eye. little case is very handy to fit in purse, cosmetic bag, etc.",1,62

"not used to the used: i thought this cd needed a review from someone who had never heard the used before and wasn't comparing it to their previous albums. that would be me.the weak tracks on this album are the slower ones, ""find a way"" and ""smother me."" a few of the other tracks may be a bit poppy for some tastes (""with me tonight"" springs to mind), but they're musically solid.i have to agree it sounds a little overproduced, but i still enjoy it immensely and listen to it nearly every day. ""pretty handsome awkward"" is particularly good when you're stuck in traffic!",1,104
"this book was extremely helpful: this book was great! it explained more types of adoption than i knew existed, even after having read some other adoption books. this book did a better job of describing all the types of adoption and more than a dozen subtypes. i thought the strategies in the book to adopt quickly and beat the odds were really clever. i liked the casual and easy manner the author explains the information. the author sounded very caring and ethical. i felt like he was just talking to me and explaining everything in a way that made complete sense to me. i found the summary of each state's laws in the back of the book and the biographies of adoption attorneys in each state really interesting and helpful.",1,130
good out of the box: the product worked perfectly for the purpose it was made. i had occasion to use it almost immediately and its accuracy was verifiable. good product and useful to have. stays in the glove box.,1,39
"compare: this book is an eloquently written, serious, and original set of lectures. the book will interest political scientists as much as historians or just simple readers ( as myself) because of its explicit orientation to "" international history"" . there is a highlight of very deep manipulation of the concepts of power, economy, and culture in order to explain why his three eras-late meiji, interwar, and postwar differ from each other.well, is not a simple analysis, and is without spelling errors , not as some reviews about it.",1,89
"great deal for quality product: i forget exactly what i paid for these headphones, but i'm pretty sure it was less the twenty bucks. the item showed up promptly, and it was just what i was looking for. a simple pair of headphones, comfortable, functional, and they sound great. if you don't need anything top of the line, and are looking for a good pair of headphones at a extremely fair price, these are for you.",1,76
"good reference book: ever since i watched an episode on the history channel about books that were not included in the bible, i have been interested in what might be in those books. i checked this book out of our local library, but found that i wanted my own copy as a reference. it has met my expectations and is a good addition to my personal library.",1,67
"greatest ever, no dvd? have to pirate!! c'mon fierlingers!: this is by far our favorite animated video for kids. johnny cash doing bling-blang? what more need be said. oh, well i guess i should point out that the animated treatments are all strokes of pure genius. that might be nice to know.somebody, anybody release these animations in dvd format, so we don't have to resort to copying to digital.",1,69
"not perfect, but more than useful: it didn't seem possible that the swiffer wet jet could work as well as the commercials. it doesn't. it's useful, though. although i use the swiffer max, swiffer wet, and the swiffer wet jet, i still find it necessary to use the dutch broom and the sponge mop every week or so to get the floor really clean.",1,64
"great movie about a fictional pope?: this movie was release many years before pope john paul ii, but looks very similar to the life of pope jp ii. great movie to watch in family. anthony quinn is superb, fantastic. you need to have in you collection. now in dvd is better.",1,51
"seriously intense: this book was given to my by a friend,along with several other books by this author. and i have to say that i was blown away! this has to be one of the most intense books i have ever read. and if someone doesn't pick up the movie rights to this book, i may have to take up a collection and do it myself.",1,66
jumping for joy: it was a great buy. just what i wanted. the setup and installation was simple and concise. the baby loves it!,1,24
other stuff to check out: i am a huge fan of catchy melodic girl rock/pop. if you enjoy this album then i strongly recommend that you check out the following:1) jalopy go far by zolof the rock and roll destroyer2) ready 2 pop by miss mary3) an illustrated history by puffyamiyumi,1,51
"great for cats too!: i bought one of these for my cat because she would never come in from outside when i called her. i would click it before feeding her, as i put her bowl down, and then 1-2 more times while she ate. i did it for a few weeks, then i clicked it while she was inside to call her for her dinner.now if i'm calling her from outside and she doesn't come, i'll grab the clicker and she comes running right to me. i feed her as soon as she comes home and click it again while she eats.it went through the washer/dryer once, and is still working fine.",1,113
"metheny is our mozart: while not my favorite pat metheny selections, certainly this vid will be much appreciated by metheny afficianados. watching how he makes his music is revealing, to see the facial expressions as his fingers work their magic, especially how his mouth moves - as if the sounds coming from his instrument were in reality coming from his very soul - grin - which of course, they are. a culmination of much of the life long theme that characterizes his work, which any pat metheny fan will instantly recognize, this piece is the pure essence of the man who is surely the mozart of our age.jonathan r. zylstra",1,110
"they really are unbreakable!: i don't think i'll ever hit off another tee. eight rounds in four days and i never broke a tee. the color even makes them hard to lose off the tee! (i think i managed to forget a couple i used to mark a ball in the fairway during a scramble.)no more searching for broken tees to use with irons off the par 3s. i just used an unbreakable tee and slashed away. the price is rediculously low for the experience provided. i could have used the same tee on every hole, if i hadn't loaned a few to partners!",1,104
"working great so far: this type of humidifier works ultrasonically, which is very quiet and puts out a lot of moisture. the vibrating membrane that creates the mist does get clogged over time with minerals if you have hard water. it can be cleaned to a point, but eventually it might stop misting. you will find a fine layer of sticky mineral gunk all over the room (on any exposed surface), unless you have soft water. there are additives you can put in the water to minimize this. small rooms may get too humid unless it's on the lowest setting. we have been pleased with this one so far.",1,109
historical drama: .....if you don't mind literary licence this is a pretty good story of the abolitionists and the pro-slavery forces that led to the civil war. raymond masey gives a dynamic performance as the fanatical john brown who wanted to free the slaves by inciting them to revolt......the movie also pairs errol flynn and olivia dehavilland for one of their many appearance together with the lovely miss dehavilland as the love interest of both flynn and ronald reagan with flynn emerging victorious......altogether it is an enjoyable film that combines history with fiction and a love story thrown in for good measure.,1,102
what an amazing book: i was told this book was full of ideas and i found it was more about hope and learning. yes there is so much information in the little book to understand and grasp. i didn't realize it is based on both partners wanting to reconcile. but even still i learned a lot and plan to read it again very soon. this time maybe grab a few things i skipped or missed befor.,1,76
"good read: good light reading. the antithesis to the hornblower character. entertaining, and fun to read, probably accurate in terms of 18th century seamanship.",1,24
"blues de la frontera: bone-shaking, soul-piercing flamenco-blues and flamenco-jazz. the musicians are phenomenally talented and innovative. this is a classic album that transcends genre.",1,24
great self help: good book to help save lawyer costs and to help understand the probate process. cd was a great help in writting a will.,1,26
"this book got me through basic military training. :]: i bought this book on a sunday while i was in basic training for the usaf. i really got me through some of the tougher days, and i treasure this book to this day- i have pages marked and certain sections highlighted. i love this book!",1,55
"a useful glove-compartment reference for desert travelers: this is a great guide to the abandoned mining towns littering the outback of nevada andcalifornia. there's more towns dead than alive out there! modern cities and highways are shownin black ink, and the ghost towns and historic places in red, complete with anecdotesdocumenting their significance and the years they existed. useful in combination with delorme'snevada and california atlases (which you might need to actually find these towns, given the small scale of the ghost town maps).",1,84
"burton club president: tim burton does it again like always. i love this movie ever since the first time i saw it when i was a kid. tim burton is a genious; edward scissor hands, the corpse bride and the remake of charlie and the chocolate factory if u love any of these films you'll love the nightmare before christmas. if u don't then well you're a lost cause.",1,69

"one of the all-time great westerns: ""shane"" is deservedly known as one of the great westerns.""shane"" is the story of a gunfighter who comes to the aid of a family of settlers who are being persecuted by free-rangers. there a many allusions to christ in the character of shane - his sensitivity, his serenity, his humbleness, his restraint, his self-sacrifice, even the fact he is only ever referred to by one name.shane is perfectly played by alan ladd matched by brandon de wilde as the young boy joey who idolizes shane, and jack palance is appropriately sinister as the ""bad guy"".""shane"" is superbly staged and shot with great use of foreground and background shot compositions particularly in the bar-room sequences - and who can forget the final sequence. this film more that any other mythologizes the western. a stunning achievement by director george stevens.",1,144
great!: this a great buy i highly recommend this purchase. had a funky smell on the inside but that was from the stuff they used to fill it but i washed it in the sink and the smell inst as bad.,1,41
"let the truth about the ninja be known!: this is one of the best ninja books i've read! kirtland peterson describes in depth why the public still views ninjas as violent, deadly, assassins. he describes other various ninja stereotypes. there is a lot of ninja history in this book. kirtland refers to masaaki hatsumi, stephen k. hayes, jack e. hoban, bud malmstrom, glenn j. morris, and christopher hunter/ashida kim. stephen hayes does a excellent foreword in this book. i won't spoil the rest of book for you. if you like this book, i suggest reading anything by masaaki hatsumi, stephen k. hayes, jack e. hoban, doron navon, glenn j. morris, charles daniels, bud malmstrom and richard van donk",1,118
"wonderful story, great ending: this was a good romance story. lilith, a widow sponsoring her nieces first year in london. julian's cousin is crazy about lilith's niece, ceicly. the story starts with lilith accepting another's marriage proposal. julian's cousin's mistress makes a deal with julian, if he seduces lilith in 8 weeks she will return the letters his cousin wrote her and release her hold on him. everyone in julian's family thinks the cousin is going to marry his mistress. this is a great seduction, where julian is as much seduced as lilith. not original storyline but was still good.",1,100
hally's bible commentary: the book was exactly as described. it arrived when expected and in good condition.good job,1,18
"music: ok i understand everyone's point of view in thier comparisons between the stage production and the movie. i've heard both soundtracks. personally i prefer the newer one because i can relate to it. music was never about what notes a person can hit or how well trained they are. it is about the emotion it inspires. i don't feel as much in the original cast production. it just seems more realistic that the phantom should sound more seductive to express why christine would be torn between him and pretty boy. i really enjoyed gerry's singng because when he sang i knew how he felt. that's the point isn't it?i prefered emmy as well. sarah had a tendency to make the words less understandable in order to make her training more evident.i went and saw the movie almost a week ago and still have the music there, inside my mind.i definitly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the story and thinks the phantom should be dark and more mysterious than he was portrayed prevoiusly.",1,174
"best bib ever!: i have now bought these bibs repeatedly for my own children, as well as gifts for several others. they are by far, the best bibs ever! they are soft & thin & comfortable for the kiddos to wear, yet waterproof & protect their cute little clothes. the velcro is secure but easy to use. i love the pockets, as they catch a lot of the mess & end up protecting little laps as well(& my kids have learned to eat ""seconds"" out of the pocket). they are so easy wash or rinse & they dry very quickly. i usually use one bib per day-rinse between meals/snacks & hang dry-then the bib is dry & ready for the next meal or snack. perhaps a bit more pricey than some bibs, but worth every penny! you will not regret this purchase!",1,142
where's the other trailer?: good movie and features but the trailer wasn't the one i'd seen in many times in the theater. ah well.,1,24
"great seat: i searched forever for a good seat for our daughter. i came to this one through reveiews, and i am so glad i got it. it is so easy to put in and switch from our two cars and it fits in my husbands civic, which i was very glad it did. it is so soft and our daughter loves it. she know can see out the window at what's going on around her. and unlike her baby car seat this one does not move when it is strapped in, which makes me feel so safe. i don't know how i lived without it. and knowing how well it did with front and side impact ratings is a major plus. very glad we have it.",1,127

"disturbed's best yet: let the reviews tell the story, this album is, in my opinion, one of the best albums this year. disturbed has changed their sound a little with this album and all the of the songs are completely power-packed. stricken is a very nice single and it has disturbed written all over it. guarded is also very good it has in your face sound right from the get-go. enough said. go out and buy this album, you are wasting precious time reading these reviews.",1,86
"one of the best cognitive books i've ever read: a must for those who are familiar with luria's works, assessment of cognitive processes is a wonderful book, explaining the best intelligence theory to date: the pass theory of intelligence. focusing more on abilities and not in capacities or mere base of knowledge, the pass stands for planning, attention, simultaneous and successive processes. i use a lot this theory in conceptualizing my cognitive and neurocognitive cases. the pass remedial pogram (prep) who stand for pass reading enhancement program is very useful for children with reading disorders, training them to develop succesive and simultaneous strategies. a wonderful addition to the field. if you are a cognitive psychologist or a school psychologist and do a lot of work with children this is the right book for and introduction to remedial instruction",1,138
"how to win friends and influence people: i received the product on time, however the conditions was a bit surprising in that it was not as new as expected. the book makes easy and interesting reading. this is certainly a a book for all times, a personal collection, a masterpiece in terms of reshaping ones attitude, perspective etc relating to peoples behaviour, feelings etc. product is highly recommended by me. a book for all middle and senior managers and persons who work in the public sphere.",1,86
this book will leave you.. spellbound.: i am 32 years old and still read this book. in the 90's pikes book were like the harry potter back in england and the states. it has many turns and twists. its could've made it into a movie. i want to read this book. i will keep reading till the the day that i die.,1,62
"good insight into the real paul williams: good insight into the man behind so much good music.i grew up in southern ca and during the early 1980's i used to see paul williams often where we both had breakfast 2-3 mornings a week. it was called, the old world restaurant. on the corner of sunset and horn, right across the street from the original spago. we alway said hello to one another and had idle chit-chat. he was very pleasant and was always alone. i remember what a big star he was in the previous decade and wondered what had happened to his success. after seeing the film i understand what happened.glad to see he is back and still working.",1,120
"the best routines: i thought this was one of the funniest abbott & costello dvd's i have ever seen!!! it has some of the funniest & most popular routines they do. if you like abbott & costello, you must get this!!!!!",1,41
good but not enough troubleshooting options.: the router has a good network range. and the signal strength is strong. i have had no problems whatsoever using it till now. except a minor glitch that it failed to install properly and i was not able to set-up a secure wi-fi network.,1,50
"great product & fair price: the product shipped and received as described. might not be worth $20.00, but is exactly what i wanted. i am using it for a photograph, not a document. quality materials/wall mount/glass. overall, pleased with the product.",1,41
"blessings everyday: one of the important gifts i can give my children is to introduce them the word of god. i brought this book for my 3 year old daughter and she loves it very much. ""blessings everyday"" is not just another devotional book. each page gives hope that my child will grow to become a woman of god.there is another book that i happen to dicover as i browse amazon.com is ""365 prophetic promises and blessings for your children"". i felt that this book would be useful for my 10 year old son and it is indeed a treasure found. i highly recommend both books.",1,106

relaxing: i love this cd i have wind chimes in my back yard and when i can i leave the window open. the wind chimes are very relaxing . so i decided to try a cd of wind chimes . i have a few. this is the best one. i listen to it with headphones and i never make it to the end of the cd before i fall asleep.very relaxing,1,71
"a cohesive electronic statement: this album is a huge departure from the sea and cake's previous album, oui. on oui, the songs were very warm, the synthesizers were used to support the traditional rock instruments. on one bedroom, the songs, while still engaging, are more electronic and alien. the guitar steps aside for the synthesizer, and the drum machines seem to appear more than the drum set. the division between songs that center on more traditional rock arrangements and more electronic compositions is actually pretty equal. what's amazing is that the album is cohesive enough to make the instrumental songs flow seamlessly with the heavily electronic songs. not only do the songs flow well on this album, the cover of david bowie's ""sound + vision"" makes sense next to the original compositions. so, if you're interested in the chicago music scene, if you like electronic music, or if you're a fan of tasteful light rock, go listen to this album now.",1,161
"excellent lost proto metal from south america: like flower travellin band, tarkus comes from a land that doesnt seem like it would have made an impact, but the power of zep and sabbath hit the 4 corners of the world. tarkus hailed from south america taking there name from the elp album (though sounding nothing like them). it is a great record of proto metal/doom with a zep/sabbath feel. the singing is all in spainish, which i only know a little, but it doesnt take away from the music. its almost poppy at times..but the guitar work and sound is awesome iommi-like. only 8 songs clocking in at just over 30 minutes..its too bad they never had anything after this..i would have loved to seen where they would have taken it. apparently there is still a version of this band sans the singer(who is in some religious cult) is still playing in south america..someone should record them too.",1,158
"how long does the mobile stay on and the music?: does anyone know how long does the mobile stays on and the music? my daughter likes to hear noise so i am just curious if this is worth the buy? i know the graco is no good becuase it is battery operated, but the music stays on all night for her? thanks",1,62
when mama comes home: we have been using this book in our child development center for years. i love this book and bought one for my 6 month old granddaughter (who is red headed like her mom) that lives in haiti. (missionaries)the illustrations are as pretty as the writing.,1,49
this is an amazing book.: suzanne zuercher puts enneagram in the center of christian spirituality. she opens a new prespective and give the reader a sense of belonging and accepting our own personality. i love how benedictines teach the christian path.,1,41
great look and fit: quality brushed nickel finish; heavy-weighted handle works smoothly when used with the required grohe pressure balancing valve....exactly as you would expect from a german product. looks great. all solid metal components except for plastic mounting plate.,1,40
"a great little radio!: this is the second sangean dt-180 am/fm radio i have purchased. i needed to get a second one as my wife was always taking mine to use when she worked out. a great little radio that i use on my motorcycle, at work, and just out and about. long battery life and it picks up the stations i listen to. very happy with this radio. i suggest buying your own earphones. the ones with this radio are just odd.",1,83
"beautiful gift: this dragonfly turquoise gemstone ring is so pretty. i originally bought it as a gift for my sister but once i received it i liked it so much that i kept it for myself and gave her the butterfly ring i bought for myself instead. so, it made a beautiful gift to myself.",1,55
"great camera: i bought this camera to use while my husband is deployed. not only is the picture terrific, but the in-line mike catches all the sounds in the house. not only can he hear and see me, but he can hear our birds singing in the background, our nieces laughing, our teenage son leaving for work etc.. great price and great quality, i'd recommend it to anyone looking for a webcam. it waas super easy to install as well.",1,80
nice!!!!!: i love the contents of this magazine from cover to cover! the only reason why i'am giving it only 4 stars is because the copy i received has non acceptable damaged at the cover; but yet this may be the fault of either the company or the delivery agency... i'' get back with more info when the next copy arrives.,1,61
"very good: i found myself thinking ""why would they cast this lady as jane eyre"" she is not very attractive but as the movie went on i found myself really wanting her to come out on top so it must just work. i really enjoyed the actors and actresses it was great.",1,52
a very good read: the book is very well written and entertaining even if you never played fantasy baseball. it's a nice contribution to the current debate between the traditional approach on baseball and the new sabrmetrics way of thinking the game,1,42
not bad for the price: you get what you paid for. the silicone is a bit thinner than the expensive brands and you need to be slightly careful when you handle the cover since it can easily tear. but once its on the controller it does the job.,1,48
"hear, have a hit: stephen puts it out there, and that just sums up where he's coming from to where he's at.",1,22
"drum and candle: i lived in rio de janeiro for some 5 years, teaching and coaching in both english and portuguese .. this book was my suggested ""primer"" before arriving for the first time to understand the wild ""religion"" known as ""umbanda"" or ""macumba"" ... i saw most of the ceremonies noted in this book ""first hand"" in my 5 some years in rio .. often at knifepoint .. often as the only ""white guy"" in the crowd ... it is stunningly realistic ... but returning to rio many years later, these ""practices"" are all but disappearing .. anyways .. for me ... it is a ""travel back in time"" to when on sunday when the 99% of the population would visit a catholic church, and then light their ""macumba candles"" on the way out ... ""just in case!"" easy reading ... highly recommended if you have any interest in developing brazilian society!",1,153
"paslode quality as usual: i have owned this nailer for about a year now, and it has definitely lived up to its expectations. i have trimmed out houses, cabinets, and various small projects with no problems at all. the quick release jamming mechanism is a great idea, but i've only had to use it once since i've had the nailer(this thing just won't jam up). it has good power but won't send the nail spiraling through the wood. of course the swivel exhaust port comes in handy just remember to use it. the imprint the nailer leaves on the wood is virtually none except for the nail entry hole, much better than other finish nailers that i've seen. so to make a long story short if you want a good nailer buy bostitch or craftsman, but if you want a great nailer buy the paslode.",1,145
lizzie is fun: i bought this game for my 4 and 6 year old and they love it!!! many hours of fun. it does not seem to get old.,1,29
"read this when baby is 2 weeks old: love her timeline (dropping night feeding around 8-12 weeks) and her forgiving spirit (if you've already missed that window, all is not lost, and you're not an idiot parent). i wish she'd be a little more explicit with her language sometimes. she rarely uses terms like 'cry it out,' but it is implied by statements like, 'let the baby work it out himself.' for someone not coming from a 'cry it out' approach, they might miss some of her helpful guidance because it is not direct enough.",1,95
"if you hunger for more this book will satisfy: i wonder if kevin costner even realizes the artistic and historic contribution he has made with this film. as an artist i found this book to satisfy my graphic appetite and as a romantic i have, once again, been allowed to travel back in time. mr. costner has shown us his artistic brilliance in so many ways and i thank him for his efforts. enjoy the book; it is a treasure.",1,80
"great truly all-natural conditioner: i only use aubrey hair products because all of their ingredients are truly safe enough to eat. my hair is thick, wavy/slightly curly, and tends to get frizzy. i use this conditioner at my gym because they use hard water and this one works best there. i've tried the other ""dry hair"" products and the island naturals and white camellia left my hair too soft or oily and i didn't like the smell of the desert herb as much as i like the honeysuckle rose. i use the gpb conditioner at home because i have soft water there and the honeysuckle rose can make my hair too soft. a recommendation - if you have problems selecting a shampoo and conditioner, bear the water hardness in mind and try several, especially if you shampoo at more than one place. thank you aubrey for developing and producing such wonderful products!",1,152
"funny movie- mila kunis russian goddess: pretty funny movie...if you like seth mcfarlane's humor. at least he didn't try to get all political. unlike most of these types of theme comedy, it didn't get old by the first half hour. and oh yeah- mila kunis is a russian goddess!!",1,49
historical fiction about baseball in the 1890s in japan: i really enjoyed this book. the only thing i would change is to move the historical information from the end of the book to the front of the book. i had no idea this novel was historical fiction until after i had finished reading it.i purchased extra copies to give to my baseball/softball playing grandchildren.,1,64
creative travel dock 900: what a great little product! bought it to take on vacation and i wowed my sisters with the sound. i have a bose sound dock for home but wanted a portable dock. could not believe such a tiny speaker system (fits in my tote bag) produced a very big sound. well worth the money and am so glad i purchased it.,1,65
"pedagogy of a genius: paulo freire is one of the unsung heros in the field of education. here he is again, writing such terse sentences that they have to be re-read several times to absorb all their nutrients. just like his brilliant pedagogy of the oppressed, education for critical consciousness is an antidote to the current u.s. crisis of ignorance and consumer-insanity.",1,62
a thought provoking book: this book will leave you examining what's important in life. i found myself wondering what our family would do in such a situation. it is humbling to think the lord is in control of it all and we're to seek and do his will. there was a brief mention of 9/11/01. i felt it was tasteful and appropriate. it happened such a few short years ago and is part of our history. let us not forget that tragedy while we let our mind wander and wonder: could something really cause a power outage over the entire earth? how would we survive?,1,105
"excellent series but .....: stories and acting of the highest caliber. unlike most tv dramas today, it is difficult to anticipate/predict the outcome of these stories. full of surprises and generally more realistic cold war spy thrillers than contemporary shows.the only reason for four stars instead of five is the disappointment that a&e; decided to show the british introduction instead of the johnny rivers ""secret agent man"" song that opened the show for the us audience. it helped set the tone for the show. i guess a&e; thought the british audience was bigger than the us audience - hmmmm: i wonder what they use when they think.",1,107
"don omar: i love the album, especially wit my songs scandalous and the reggaeton latino remix. i cant stop playin it. gotta keep it up wit the reggaeton. don omar is a hit maker.",1,34
"a nice game yet homers are too common: this game is a really good game, except that homeruns are too common. also, the scoring is high. once, i was detroit and the computer was tampa bay. the pitcher was wilson alvarez. in the 1st inning i scored 28 runs. also in the same inning 6 players hit homeruns all in a row. (i traded for some of these players) ken griffey jr.,sammy sosa, bob higginson, mark mcquire, mike piazza, and deivi cruz hit 1 run homeruns all in that order. in that game i won 98-1!! what was that about??? the graphics are great. in homerun derby i was mike piazza the computer todd helton. i scored 29 homers and helton scored 0 homers.another thing i hate is that i can crush homers off of randy johnson, pedro martinez, but i can't crush off of mike magante! it's crazy. everything else is grreattt!!!!!",1,153

"they... cannot... touch... her...: the most beautiful words ever said in a movie. greatest actor in film directed by one of the greatest. de niro manages to let us look deep into the soul of (insomniac vietnam-veteran) travis. it has all the good ingredients for a really breathtaking classic. i watch it twice a year (except for the first year of course), and never get tired of it. truly an extraordinary good movie.",1,73
"the titans are back: in this comeback of the teen titans, starfire invites the teen sidekicks of the dc universe to reform the teen-powered super team. as expected with teen sidekicks, they are all anxious to get out of the shadows of their mentors. of course if the teen titans return, their nemesis deathstroke will show up. in fact, the battle between the teen titans and deathstroke is the highlight of this book as the young heroes pit their skills against the wily mercenary. surprisingly, the teen titans also go up against the jla! since wonder girl joined the titans without wonder woman's approval, wonder woman shows up to enforce her wishes. of course it gets out of hand, and the two teams support their members. teen titans: a kid's game is a fun read, and is recommended to fans of the teen titans.",1,144
"a dream come true: this dictionary is everything you could ever wish, and yes, it is the very first. these very many and every original, clear old english definitions is not that of today's complex excess baggage terms defined, but it even contains the sources of the many instances used. as a bible reader, i found and understood almost everything i looked for in my kjv bible, however the size is a bit bulky, but i got what i paid. 'one look search dictionary' (http://www.onelook.com) has it free online, but it seems less complete. this book did not disappoint me.",1,100
classic: this game is a classic and a work of art.these are the things that are awesome about this game (spoilers(?))- vultures- freaky giant spider- grues (you will defecate in your pants they are seriously scary)- cliff's comedy club- mine-cart ride- headache commercial on hotel room wall screen- the guy that shows up when you kill someone you're not supposed to,1,61
lots of questions!: this review book for high school biology is a great review resource filled with hundreds of practice questions. there are also loads of diagrams and charts that make studying the material much easier and less time consuming.,1,40
want want big shelly crispy rice crackers (sugar) - one of my favorite snacks!!: i love these crackers...to me they are the perfect blend of salty and sweet and go great with peanut butter! i am happy to find them on amazon and not to have to drive 1.5 miles to an asian market.,1,54
amigo standard uke: the amigo standard uke is a descent uke. it sounds great when it is in good tune. not a bad uke probably a good choice for beginners. this was my first uke purchsed.,1,36
"it was a good book with many funny parts in the story.: the story is overall a great book to read, but if you expect 10 people to read the book, i will bet that not all of them would read it willingly. i read it, but i know that i would not finish it if it hadn't for a grade or a requirement in school. the story have become more interesting from chapter 9 and on, but the chapters before that seems like it would take forever to read through it.",1,92
"frindle by d12: do you like books that you absolutely cannot put down? then frindle by andrew clements is the book for you! this book is about a boy named matt who has to do a homework assignment about how the words in a dictionary were made. while he is doing the report, he learns that words are just made up for no particular reason, so he makes up his own his own word instead of a pen he calls it a frindle. after a few weeks, the whole town is saying the word. i liked this book because it is funny and realistic. this book would be better for people under thirteen because i don't think people over thirteen will think it is funny. i say that because it will only take adults about 45min. to read this book. since the kids will take longer to read the book they will understand it better. to really enjoy this book you have to read it slowly. i highly recommend this book for you.",1,173
friendly persuasion: this is one great movie! gary cooper at his best! dorothy mcguire is charming and anthony perkins before being type-cast as a psycho is superb!if you like james stewart in shenandoah then friendly persuasion is for you. two great movies with similar themes.,1,45
"adorable!: everyone fell in love with this costume. it was nice and warm for the rain and snow we had that night. the only problem i had with it was that the huge collar never wanted to stay up, so people had to ask what he was. as soon as i held it up, they knew exactly what he was supposed to be. i tried ironing it, but it didn't help. i think it was just layed down too long the wrong way in the package. other than that it was great. most people loved how original it was for such a small age. my son looked majorly snazzy in it! i almost wish the cape could come off so he could just wear the suit around because he looked so cute in it!",1,134
"i liked it: i liked the way the book didn't get bogged down in too much math. the capital budgeting chapters were clear, much more to the point than the textbooks i tried to read.",1,35
"simple and works fine.: these are best suited for hanging as shown, rather than floors or flat surfaces (imho). mine worked well in my tests and is a bit louder than some. decent value for the price, i think. this design is a bit different than most others and well suited for hanging on a tub or basin (or whatever) to prevent overflow. can also be used for leak detection, but the wire is very stiff, so in some situations the simpler, ""just sit it down on the floor"" designs are easier to use. but this is better if you need to feed the ""detector"" into an enclosed area or pan.",1,111
"most comfortable shoes ever: i purchased the boots for myself, but my daughter wears them around the house all the time. they're like wearing slippers. they're that comfortable. so now, my daughter wants a pair.",1,35
"should be the first of a new series!: i was surprised that this mystery-thriller was so well written. nikki hill has great promise as a continuing character, as do several others in the story. interesting plot and the da office setting could even be expanded.i'd like to know how much was written by darden & how much by lochte.",1,59
"pleasant and recommended reading (but plot could be better): the elegant writing and the well-paced daily life of the main character in this book make for a pleasant, rewarding reading. the descriptions of places and people are very nice.it's good to learn that ron ely, after gracing our tvs in tarzan stories, produced a nice written work like this.i found the plot a bit weak, and it shows especially at the end. i would have given the book 3 and a half stars, if that was possible.",1,87
"fantastic: i have followed collegium for a while and was a little daunted with their recent trend for bringing out 'contemporary' composers. i now believe this to be a fantastic idea, having listened to this disc - what a discovery o'regan is!well done collegium - i want to hear more!",1,50
eliza: eliza dushku running through the woods in a shapely tank top. that alone is worth the purchase price. she is the only reason i bought jay and silent bob strike back.,1,32
"trigger happy me!!!: i totally love the album. ""trigger happy jack"" and ""another world"" are the best songs. poe's sound is differenent from pj harevey, tori amos, and fiona apples, as they have been compared (i don't know why?). poe as a really pretty voice, and plays piano very well. this is a very good album, everyone should own it. if only she could get more radio play....",1,68
"it is so cool!: he has got a unique sound, that makes you feel like you are on cloud 9. makes you wanna tap your toe. so go out and buy ""the ego has landed"", it will be a great addition to your cd collection!",1,45
"just as described...needs more description: i know that bike racks don't have instructions, but come on....we need at least some specifications....what bikes it fits, which ones it doesn't. btw ladies, it does not fit a small giant cypress!!! :( i liked it a lot though...on to bike rack #3",1,49
"great camera!: i've had an olympus camera (1.3 mp, those were good ol' times), a sony cybershot (4.1 mp) and a canon powershot a520, but this one beats all of them and more.the screen is great, it takes great photos and the autofocus comes very handy (especially for us lazy guys who do not want to take manual pics).the only drawback this camera has, and this is a negative feature for all canon cameras (canon, can you hear me?), is that it doesn't show battery status but only when it is almost done with batteries. i guess you can live with that (i've had), but it would be nice to have a battery meter so i know what to expect.",1,120
"all lids should be like this: it looks a little like a medieval torture device, but the little cones on the underside of the lid allow moisture to drop back into the pan. why doesn't everyone do this? plus the lids has two little tabs that fit over the pour spouts of the pan - perfect! nice tight fit. great for anything that needs to stew for awhile.",1,68
"man, these are baaad: by bad, of course i mean good.these things are terrific. i've been using them a month. can do 45 straight push ups already. i am seeing improvement in my upper body. the motion you get with these are wide-ranging. i also appreciate that the handles are thicker and studier than other similar push up grips. but these are in a class of their own. get them and you'll be glad that you did.",1,77
"altogether a great cd: while i think it's fair to say that orbital rarely disappoints, i find their latest effort excellent. within minutes oflistening to the the first few tracks i was hooked. the altogether will definitely be in my cd rotation for a while.from the perspective of orbital's past works, i find this cd better than middle of knowhere and nearly on par (andsoon to supersede?) in sides. if you've enjoyed orbital's past work, then you should enjoy this cd. for those ofyou who don't like orbital (which i believe is an acquired taste), you may begin to change your mind after hearingwhat they've done on the altogether.",1,109
good...: this purchase i made for my daughter as caillou is her favorite character and she like this very much. worth buying...i recommend...,1,23
nice earrings from amazon: i bought the earrings for my daughter who adored them. they were small but bright and looked great. we went to view the floats the night before the rose parade and a couple of her friends commented on them. she loves them.,1,46
better than a diaper bag: i use this instead of a diaperbag. it holds more and i can organize things better so i don't have to dig around for what i need. the only complaint is that it seems like the fabric jansport uses doesn't seem as sturdy and thick as it used to be. we'll see how it holds up.,1,61
nice gadget: overall i like this headphone and it serves it's purpose. the radio is pretty clear and the remote control is a neat feature. one bad thing is the cord from the the adapter to the remote control is too long. it is very hard to manage and gets tangle very easily.,1,53
great: my six year old got this for christmas. he loves it. it has really helped him with his fine motor skills. plus it is a lot of fun.,1,29
"good story line and nice lesson for pre-schoolers!: good story line and nice lesson for pre-schoolers! can remind toddler of the situation, and how little foot and his friends handled it.",1,31
the perfectly named film: this film is so much fun i didnt want it to end. amy adams is transcendent in her role as the princess to be giselle. she shouldve gotten an oscar for this performance. for me it is one of the most enjoyable and delightful performances ive seen in a long time.i had to practically be forced to watch this film since it seemed on the surface like a kids film i didnt want to see. i was wrong. it is a film for everyone. it is funny and touching and has scary moments and great singing and dancing and its a beautiful film to behold in every way.i loved this film.,1,115
best of the best: this action packed movie is based on 3 episodes called 1. the third element 2. buyer beware 3. stormy weather this is a must see movie its a great video and it comes out on july 10.,1,41
"truly gnarly: ""gnarl!"" is the companion volume to ""seek!"" and probably one of the best story collections i've ever read. featuring almost the entirety of rucker's professional short-story output, ""gnarl!"" includes hysterical and visionary pieces reminiscent of authors ranging from kurt vonnegut to bruce sterling (whose collaborative effort ""big jelly"" is featured here alongside gems co-written with marc laidlaw and paul de fillipo). as far as collections go, ""gnarl!"" is becomingly introspective, and can be read as a transrealist autobiography. rucker creates grim futures and funny scenarios that cover the spectrum of human emotion. pac-man addiction. religious fervor. microgravity sex. beatniks and hydrogen bombs. time warps and deranged aliens. ""gnarl!'s"" got it all. you can't come away from the experience unmoved.",1,121
"great headphones. great value.: i think these have got to be the best headphones for the money out there. i've had mine about a year and an super pleased with them. from great sound, great comfort, i am very happy. i mainly got them to use on flights where i was sick of the engine noise breaking in to the music. i had been using some over ear headphones, but needed something smaller. much smaller. enter these sony's.i will concur with one review i read below - the rubber that houses the wires broke down on my and exposed the wires. annoying, for sure, but i'm just getting another pair. it took them a year and a half of daily use for this to happen, so i am not concerned.",1,130
"yet another 5 stars!: been using this for many years now, still the best overallconditioner i have ever used. leave it on for 10 minutes if youcan (per directions from years ago) for therapeutic results on hairand scalp. only downside is it will take toll on coloring if you color your hair, so you may want to rotate usage with another of your favorites.",1,64
"suprisingly good book: i purchased the book to satisfy my curiosity. i was not expecting to learn much since i've been investing for some time. i was wrong. not only is the book crammed with useful information, but it is very easy to read with abundant graphics and humor.i recommend the book to all, both beginner and experienced investor.",1,59
"a west virgiania libraian: i thought this was a hilarious movie, eddie murphy plays dr. dolittle who discovers he has the ability to talk to animals.hilarity ensues.",1,27
"great show, very wide: i ordered these shoes to wear for capoeira street rodas, and they seemed great but they were too wide. i was able to give them to a friend that has wider feet and she thinks they're great. i was really disappointed that they didn't fit me. although they look unisex, the width may be better for men.",1,61
funny potty humor: really funny if you don't mind encouraging your child in the direction of potty humor. better when read with an english accent.,1,25
"love this dvd: this is an excellent dvd. i love it because it teaches while girls can be little princesses, they can still do things for themselves. my little girl loves it and i highly recommend it!",1,37
"great cd!: when you listen to this album, it will transport you back to andalucia (southern spain). i studied abroad in seville over a year ago and this band had just made thier debut and me ponga colorada was heard everywhere! the cd has a great blend of flamenco, pop music and moroccan flavor that you won't find on any other spanish cd. i cannot wait for their next album.",1,70
"reality and fiction - keeps you thinking it could be true!!: koontz always gets things going, and never lets go. this is the case here. the descriptions and not ""too"" far fictional characters often keep my pondering if this type of sick character could be real some day or present day.",1,51
"well-shod: this book is an execellent tool to keep on hand, if you're a hosre owner. its helpful for the time between the farrier appointments.",1,25
a really great plastic measuring beaker: you pour stuff in; and you pour it back out again.then you clean it up for next time.and you get what you pay for.perfectly good choice.,1,32
"great service,: if you haven't read any of these books to your children or grandchildren, you are missing something special. these are fun and adventurous ways to teach the alphabet.",1,30
"best way to get into the series: i got this with spirit camera and i have to say that was a nice way to crash course into the series. seriously, its scary and even though you have a sister near you, its unnerving. anyway, you'll enjoy this if you are looking for a scary story to play through.",1,58
"best gift i ever received.: my husband gave me the kindle for my birthday and it was the best gift he ever gave me (for my birthday). even better than my laptop! i have arthritis in my hands so holding books has been painful for me. the kindle is lighter and easier to hold than a book, and i am so happy to be able to read, read, read. thanks, honey, for the wonderful 58th gift you've given me for my birthday. now you all can figure out when i met my husband, and how old i am!",1,98
awesome comedy: this is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen! from beginning to end there is never a dull moment. definetly worth watching.,1,26
"good good good good good: very good... not just typical big beat stuff, rather, electronic of all sorts.. much more expansive than other artists in same tech-popular genre.",1,28
"miss pattycake is great!: my little girl who is two can't get enough of miss pattycake, and it is such a blessing to see her jump and clap and praise the lord with the songs as she watches!",1,38
"what a steal!: this budget-priced laser printer is quiet and delivers your documents most expeditiously! note to macintosh os x users: the latest driver can be downloaded from the manufacturer's website so you won't have to revert to os 9 whenever you need to print. hopefully this will save you some time and trouble, because there were no editorial comments or customer reviews before i purchased this! i selected four stars because there is a slight pause after issuing the command to print, but the pause is negligible and hardly worth mentioning.",1,92
"a great book!: this is a must-have for dog owners and fanciers alike! i bought this with my birthday money, and the humorous text urged me to snatch it from the shelves. it's a book to read when in the bowels of ""dog ownwer despair"". if you love or like dogs, this is a book you need to have!",1,59
"one of the first, and best girl bands: four women ahead of their time. their album, fanny hill has some of my favorite songs- ever. i like their rendition of bulldog, almost better than the beatles. 'you have a home' is one of the most beautiful songs- the message is very poignant- most single mothers can relate. listen to 'ain't that peculiar and i bet you become a fan.",1,69
"miracle in maryland: the chesapeake bay area surrounding annapolis is a wonderful place to live. the author of this medical fantasy story describes local neighborhoods and live experiences with focused accuracy. there is much to learn about piloting an airplane that is revealed by the author's vast knowledge of that subject but the relevance to the whole story escaped me. perhaps, one must rise above all the details on the surface of the earth to see the whole picture and make such a seemingly simple but amazing medical discovery. the greatest asset of this book is to remind readers that helping mankind is much more important than the potential monitary reward associated with an invention or a discovery. the second most important asset of this book is the pure learning experience about historical facts from a very learned author.",1,139
"the garmen streetpilot c330: the garmin streetpilot c330 is sure one neat little invention. use it around town or on a long road trip, you will not be disappointed. no need for lengthy instructions. most people can figure out how to use it right out of the box. no set up is required. you can set it to find an address, find the name of a restaurant, or a hotel. you can ask it to find you food by category such as italian, fast, and many more choices. it will give you a list from closest to furthest away. same with lodging. it will give the phone numbers of the choices too. i am a trucker and have found it invaluable to my daily job. once in awhile it might be off by a few house numbers, but it has no problem getting you on the right street. a great buy!",1,151
"very good quality !: am happy with this purchase, my wife tried these on and the size and width were perfect, its amazing the amount of work that go""s into these boots, the company uses quality material and workmanship and yet charges awesome prices that makes it easy for anyone to own a pair of boots from propet, am very happy with this purchase and happy wife means happy life lol !",1,72
"gift of love: this wonderful little book offers many choices for mealtime blessings that are especially appropriate to thank our provider and source for the daily bread that graces our tables. as we increase our connection to the divine spirit, one will find blessings to suit any and all occasions whether eating alone, with others, or in a restaurant. this collection of blessings is a gift of love!",1,68
awesome!: this is a subject i have always been interested in. i think the book covers the struggle for the city very well. from the grewsome deaths from starvation to the breakdown of food supplies to the fighting itself.,1,39
"lifesaver!: seven hours each way for thanksgiving... oh yes, love the headphones! would have been a much different trip without them.",1,21
"like the pattern: pattern matches my dish set. they are durable and the lids stay on. i have washed mine in the dishasher, but not the lids. sometimes plastic warps and i want the lids to keep fitting. they stack and store nicely inside each other which is a spacesaver.",1,50
"captivating: this was the first koontz novel i ever read and i could not put it down. the depiction of the characters and images seen through the eyes of chris snow was incredible. as the book neared the end i found myself wishing for it not to be over. i felt like i was right there going through the ordeal myself. koontz pulled me in and has not let me go. i have read several other great books by him since, but none of them hooked me like seize the night.",1,91
"terrific book!: i found this book to do just what i had hoped. it's like a syllabus from a very smart, highly organized professor, who fleshes out the subjects just enough, and lets you know where exactly to look for more. it's concise, intelligent, and informative, and it saved me a lot of time in working out an outline on the subject (i'm an art professor myself). cynthia freeland -- thank you! what clarity!",1,74
"good for beginners: it's ok if you are buying it for small kid. easy assembly, good look, kid loves it. but, this is for very small kid and may not last for 2 to 3 years for growing kid. although it has adjustable seat but not very balanced after much height. i would rather have little bigger than this one.",1,60
"cast iron cookbook: i thought this would be a nice cookbook to have since i am new to cast iron cooking. i found i really have not used it though.i seem to just make things on my own, but there are a couple recipes i'd like to try sometime.",1,49
"it's interesting..: werewolf was my first introduction to world of darkness. i enjoyed it, but, reading the other books pointed out to me that werewolves are definitely a better platform for storytellers than players - they're either too weak or too powerful! new players will find themselves darting away from a vampire or hunter with any kind of experience, where as someone who actually finds standing in the garou nation will be able to kill off justicars and femorachs without breaking a sweat.you could play a campaign, of course, but, it'll take some effort to make high-leveled characters keep interest. buyer beware!",1,102
wonderful!: gives the reader a wonderful and clear picture of how egypt has changed throughout history. i send a thank you to the author.,1,24
"ultra cheese - but in a really good way.: this is one of those ""great shows"" from my childhood and it was a lot of fun to revisit it after all these years. its really good that the price has dropped by about half however, i mean seriously.... this sure isn't hamlet. the show is cheesy and cheap, but not in a bad way at all. i found it quite entertaining still. and it is really a treat to see the eternally classy and beautiful lee meriwether at what is perhaps the pinnacle of her elegance and grace.the show is more serious then, and far less classic then, lost in space or batman. but it provides the same type of wholesome campy entertainment that has made those shows tv legends. if you don't like cheese however, look elsewhere.",1,138
"very good for it's price: it's nicely built, very fast thanks to it's f/1.4 and has very smooth and quite autofocus.as most of reviews noted, it is very soft in the corners when stopped down but with this kind of lens, you don't really care for the edges, especially as you get a wider angle than most of it's competitors in the category.i am very pleased with it, but if you are looking for a good portrait lens i would recommend the canon 50mm f/1.4 instead.it will be much sharper at corners and will cost less.",1,96
"music protector: as a musician, i actually bought this to use when i play outdoor concerts to keep the music on the stand instead of using paper clips on windy days. works like a charm!",1,35
the best rpg ever: i never really got into rpgs my friends got me to play vampire once or twice but it was boring and i played wraith whcih was cool because of the great war expansion but this has to be the best rpg ever most of my friends and me loved the card game and we developed our own storyline for our campaign form the card game it was very fun and we had a huge battle at beiden pass that rivaled the scorpion clan coup this game is great,1,92
"used for a year, still going strong!: came to amazon so i can send the product link to a friend, decided to write a review.love this product, it just works and never gives us problems.",1,35
"silly, silly fun!: this is not a high-brow comedy, but neither is it the typical low-brow stuff being produced today that focuses on bodily functions and groin punches. this is british comedy, which means that it actually has some wit, in between the sight gags. if the comedy of peter sellers, the absurdity of monty python, and the sheer outlandishness of the rocky horror picture show appeal at all to you, then this movie will tickle at least one funny bone.",1,81
"an excellent resource for teachers, parents, and caregivers!: this book has many helpful, fun and task specific activities that work for children during their most formative years. i have found this book to be invaluable. the games are beneficial for teaching and reinforcing specific skills, and they are entertaining enough to keep kids interested. most of all, the games really work! the games don't take much time or extreme effort, but they pay off extremely well. if you are the parent or teacher of young children, you will find yourself referring to this book again and again.",1,97
"replacement straps for old lamp: the price was good and delivery excellent. the reason for buying this item is my old straps are looking like failure could be imminent.always be prepared. ps: this is a simple design that kicks the behind. a creative guy can build his own mounting system for a number of things with these straps. for me, it was an elevated head lamp for use with a works enduro rider steering dampener.",1,75
"25th anniversary: for a long time, there wasn't a lot of asia video out there. then came some bootlegs, then the music videos and concerts in russia and europe. finally....a concert that spans the entire musical careers of all the members!!! it is so nice to see and hear songs from yes, king crimson, elp, and even...the buggles. for me, the highlight was asia doing a monster version of ""fanfare for the common man"". the band truly seemed to enjoy the variety of material, as well as all the classic asia songs. would have liked to see ""go"" played, but that is covered in other collections. i like steve howe, but pat thrall actually did a nice job in his asia stint. palmer is palmer....the king! downes is a creative force, and wetton has been one of my favorite vocalists since the 70's. asia fans....this is a must buy!!!!!!!!!!!!",1,149
"a helpful, well laid out book: theodora philcox has created a very helpful book on the still life. there is a wide range of styles and several very fine artists. philcox takes the artists' own explanations of their techniques and adds some of her own helpful comments and observations. styles of art are juxtaposed giving the reader a good view of different approaches to their art. of special interest is the work of artist timothy c. tyler whose realistic and brushy artwork steals the show.",1,85
"best dance album for 2006: i bought a lot of dance, trance, electronic, cd and this is my favorite album for 2006. very good beat and vocal. a good choice for club hits fan...",1,34
"worth the money!: this mat is definately worth the extra money. i practiced yoga five days a week for 4 months, blowing out one cheaper mat and causing significant signs of wear on the second one. once this mat is broken in, i found it to not only be quite sticky, but also to provide excellent cushioning for me knees. it is also larger than most other mats, so there is less need to read just your position on the mat as frequently to avoid contact with others in a crowded yoga class.this mat is also excellent for those wanting to practice yoga at home on carpet. my other mats always slid around on my carpetted floor, but this one is heavy enough to stay put. if you are committed to a yoga practice, invest in this mat and you won't regret it. the only negative is that it is so heavy i would not necessarily recommend it to yogis that walk or bike to class.namaste!",1,166
"accurate and durable weight: this is an accurate and durable weight. i have read numerous articles about free weights being off. i weighed mine and they were accurate. the only thing that kept them from getting five stars is that they are on the bulky side likely due to the neoprene coating. i am female 5'7"" with long thin fingers. if my fingers were not on the longer side it may be hard to grip these well. they work for me, but i would be careful if you have tiny hands.",1,91
"the best cheap stereo: the design is nice, the mechanics a little awkward, the tape drive is funky, and the remote is flimsy but the sound, oh, my, the sound is wonderful. it's far better than my $250 sony and better overall than any other stereo that i've owned.i know, i know, it's hard to believe a $50 stereo sounds great but this one does. try it in the store, if you can. i'm not sure how or why it sounds so much better than everything else available for less than $250 but it does.",1,95
"a must-read for the budding geographer: i'm working on my phd in geography. this was a required text for a first-year graduate seminar on ""history and theory of geography"". this book gives a biographical sketch of numerous recent luminaires in geography. the book is easy to read because it's broken down into nice nuggets of information about a specific geographer and makes mention of how their work relates to other geographers also in the book. granted, it's not comprehensive, but it does give a good foundation in the theories behind modern geography.if you are into geography (with a capital-g) and not just geography, buy this book. even if you don't read it right away, it'll find a comfortable spot on your bookshelf.",1,122
"vince vaughn!!: vince vaughn should be pete tyler! keanu reeves might be okay, too, but vince vaughn would be better. john cusask already played the guy in 'high fidelity' who was a loser, by the way, and pete tyler is much cooler and better boyfriend material. everyone should read this book 'cause it's great and then write vince vaughn and tell him to do the movie!",1,66
"best western ever: gritty, dirty and downright manly. the overgrown adolescents of today need to study this film and learn how to act like a man. no tattoos, ear-rings or other piercings to smother the y gene. little music is used; some of the 40s and 50s flicks were embellished with over the top, histrionic scores combating rather than complimenting the plot. the dialogue is short, cutting and to the point. i especially like the ""he-girl"" comment. another william wellman masterpiece; get this film. dvd transfer is superb.",1,88
"excellent presentation of efforts towards peace: this documentary was co-produced and directed by israelis and palestinians. it presents an in-depth view of efforts by people from both sides toward mutual understanding. full of stories that we should all hear, but don't. a must-see for anyone interested in peace in the region.",1,51
"this coffeemaker rules!: if you truly enjoy great coffee, this coffeemaker is the one! i have never tasted such good coffee made in someone's home and rarely even at fine restaurants. i feel like i'm at starbuck's everyday even when i don't grind my own beans. i almost bought the regular mill and brew and i'm so glad i waited and got the carafe minus the heating element. you may have to tweak the coffee to water ratio but be patient grasshopper - it is so worth it!",1,88
clever and easy: very clever layout and easy to understand recipes. the beautiful photos make a snap to imagine cooking these things yourself. highly recommended!,1,25
"fantastic: i just got these and opened them about 10 minutes ago. i was a bit unsure about getting them, what with the 1 star reviews, but i thought what the hell and took a chance. i have to say i am glad - 1 star reviewers must have strange ears as as well as being comfortable, they have a great sound. i am on pretty low volume and i can't hear the keys as i type. the design is great - they fit fine, and they are almost unnoticable.",1,90
"a good book!: i think this book is a all right type of book. i know life has its struggles, but there is nothing worth running away from. i believe it was a couldn't keep the book down group, but i believe nothing is worth running away from.",1,48

"the first professional packaging book i have: i have looked and analised the book, and compared with the peppin press books, this book is all you need to learn and study packaging design.this book will teach me and maybe you how we can design packaging.all cash deserved",1,47
"the best choice i think: the same work conducted by klempeler with philharmonia orchestra is famous. but i promise this live recording is better and it's the best one i've heard(including walter,bernstein,rattle,mehta,kaplan and other klem's one). klempeler's reading is insightful and the bavarian radio symphony orchestra played so warm and powerful that i think it is better than the philharminia orchestra especially for its brass. the remastering of this disc is succesful,the sound is more rich than other version. though there's several cough-sound,it's never mind.i'll give it 6 star if i could.",1,92
good history: very informative and well written. when i started reading this i had no idea how exciting cereal was. it is very comparable to the personal computer revolution of the 1980s. a true history of americana that seems to been forgotten in our times (2004).,1,46
"an exellent transfer of a rather stupid little movie...: i liked this movie, not because of it's plot,but because of vladimir tytla's artwork on it.frankly the movie [stinks], but the transfer and artwork are magnificent. i found crusty to be the only character that was any fun. i can only recomend this disc for serious animation collectors only. if you want a fun movie, go somewhere else.",1,67
lots of fun: this was the first dildo my wife and i tryed when i opened the package there was a strong smell to it but after washing it with soap and letting it air out a few days the smell is much less. we have played with it a few times now and we love it.,1,57
"well worth the money: i recently bought a c-50 with some reservations about picture quality based on other user reviews. however, i am very pleased with this excellent little camera and the pictures have amazed my friends.the camera is easy to use and takes just a few minutes to master. the battery life is good comapared to other digital cameras i have owned.my only beef is that there is no sound on the movie mode (which takes good quality (though brief) movies.the included software is barebones, but adequate, also, the included manual is weak although there is a full one on the cd.i would certainly reccomend this camera to anyone.",1,110

"good purchase: purchased this item for my boat (sea ray 175 sport 3.0l). on initial install the carb diameter hole was a bit to small so the flame arrestor would not fit onto the carb flange. this was corrected with a dremel tool, after a small bit of grinding it slid right into place. the next step was finding a threaded rod log enough so the arrestor could be secured to the carb, after a trip to napa (local auto supply store) that issue was also corrected. finally fired the boat up yesterday on muffs and she purred like a kitten and looks good too. cant give details on performance yet but i am hoping k&n claims are as accurate as they say. one suggestion i have is, i would like to see an all inclusive kit with everything needed to do the job for your application.",1,147

"great book: i am using this book for beginning chinese. it is very good because it has easy vocabulary for a beginner and gradualy turn difficult. i like specially the first section that tell you about the radicals, and certain rules for the use of pinyin that other books don't tell you, which makes you pronounce the words incorrectly. and also i like the chart that tell you the manner to pronounce the chinese letter which are different than english ones, such as the ""ch"" which it is not exacltly the english ""ch"", as well as the ""r"", or ""zh"" or other.the con ot that the audio does not come with the book, i do not know where to get it because it was provided in my class.",1,128

"must have: this device was recommended to me and i cannot say enough good things about it. it's very effective and broke my very loud, large lab of barking in just a few days. i agree with previous posts that you must put a verbal and/or hand signal to make this work long term. now, i just have to tell my dog ""no bark"" and he will stop. we have found other uses for this device such as breaking up play that has become too rough between our dogs.",1,89
"great for seniors & kids: we recently bought .mac for our 90 year old mother, who loves email & surfing on her imac, but needs a very stable, simple platform. she recently moved to an independent living apartment with high speed internet, but the provider does not provide email addresses and expects users to access web-based email, which we know is just too confusing & too many steps for our mother, who is very used to apple mail. now she has a .mac address, completely integrated by the apple os, & it took less than 5 minutes. yes, it's an expensive mailbox, but i'm so glad it is available.",1,109
"a trip down memory lane: looking at this book now in the age of pc, i can see how some people could find some of the content offensive. but they have to realize that this captures folklore that wasn't considered offensive at the time. the book has some really funny jokes and games from childhood...remember making fortune tellers, jacobs ladders, cats cradle? ooh, and the: ""my mom will kill me if she heard me tell one single dead baby joke"".i first purchased this book in 1988 to have on hand when my neices and nephew's visited me. i then lent it to a few people through out the years, i recently had to replace it because my children just plain wore the book out.",1,124
"tmnt!: this was a great deal for all 4 of the tmnt movies. me and my brother watched these growing up, so it was a great trip down memory lane watching them again!",1,33
"heavy hitter with durability: i received this speaker system for my birthday many years ago and it still hits very hard after having gone through years of abuse. i love my bass-hitting music and even turn it up so that i can hear my music from my bedroom while i'm in the shower. the bass has been blasted so loud with bass-test songs that shelves have emptied themselves all over my floor as well as multiple drinks having fallen off of my desk. this system located upstairs on the second floor makes the support columns located outside of my house by the front door vibrate when it is at 3/4 volume with bass all the way up. this is by far worth the 100$ and i was surprised to find out it has 200w rms. i had been thinking it was atleast 500w rms.great buy! however, if you're a parent expecting to get any sleep do not buy it for your child, your house will shake.",1,166
"linksys router: it is a good router, when it workers properaly, but my main problem is with my isp and that i have to regester the mac adress and linksys had 3 different mac adresses for their wireless routers.",1,39
"beautiful game with lots of options!: now, bear in mind -- i'm not an avid gamer - in fact i rarely play computer games altogether nowadays. my favorite games were in the late 80's early '90s when game play was paramount over flashy graphics.i purchased this program after trying it out for a few weeks via freeverse's website. this game is very similar to activision's 80's version of shanghai -- except that it's gorgeous to look at, has terrific gameplay, and is ...(insert drum roll here) ...loads of fun!i prefer games that are easy to get into, and continue to hold my interest over time. this review would be 5 stars, but i took down one star because under macosx 10.3, i can't play any of the audio tracks on the game. freeverse software has indicated that a patch will be made available soon.highly recommended, especially for non-gamers that want a good, fun diversion every now and then. perfect for kids and adults alike!",1,164
amerock cabinet hinge: the hinges were exactly as described. often these items are described as brushed nickel and are actually brushed chrome. on top of the great value and quick service i considered this a great transaction. i had priced this exact hinge at a local big box store and saved 1.00 per set by purchasing through amazon. thank you and keep up the good work.,1,66
cute!!: i wanted something cute to put my dog food in and this works perfectly. i love that it snaps so the food stays fresh.,1,25
"must be seen to be heard: i continue to be in awe over these fine performances of the mahler symphonies by abbaddo. i had all of the mahler symphonies on cd, but must admit i appreciate mahler much more now that i get to see the orchestra. the sound, video quality and direction are perfect. they call this the tragic symphony but for me it was pure joy. i have watched some berstein performances on dvd and to date i will take abbaddo or thielmann anytime....those old video recordings do detract from my enjoyment of the pieces....and my musical training simply is not able to tell if one performance exceeds another. i did get the chailly mahler symphonies 2,8 and 9 based on reviews....the rest by abbaddo.",1,127
"read it before there is a problem: i agree with another review that this would be an excellent book for couples in pre-marriage classes. women tend to underestimate the prevalence and strength of lust issues in men. men tend to be clueless about the destruction their lust can wreck on a relationship. men and women underestimate how ""innocent"" lustful activities grow into worse and worse perversions over time, and this applies also especially to any male children they may have.it is the awful truth, but when one is fore warned one has a better chance at avoiding the dangers.",1,99
very well written first book.: drowning ruth combine good character development with page turning action. for someone who likes both these characteristics in a book - this is a good choice to read. the only problem for me was that it jumped around too much for my taste.,1,48
pool: this is a great book!!!!!!!!! if you like pool you will learn and enjoy the witty narrative at the same time,1,22
"great stool for the price: this is a great looking stool for the price--yes, assembly is a bit of a pain, but it took me about 25 minutes to put together (not too bad in my opinion)...just looks a little daunting at first seeing all the pieces it requires. the instructions and pictures are very easy to understand and follow.we haven't gotten too much use out of it yet, since both my kids are a little young yet, but i imagine a non-slip stick-on of some sort would be a good extra safety precaution to add to the stool.",1,99

"everything but the voice recorder...: i love my rio. it's tough, sleek, pocket sized and easy to use. i recomend it to anyone looking to use it as just an mp3 player. if you were however considering using the mic for anything other than personal voice notes keep looking. i purchased my rio with the hope to record and play back lectures. unfortunatly the mic is not anywhere near sensitive enough to be useful, so i'm passing my little rio on for something new.creative labs new zen vision :m is boasting a lecture quality mic as well as fm, 30gigs, movie quality olcd and an ms office linking organiser. alot of reviewers are calling this thing the ipot killer and they might be right. i am so in love with these funky swiss army knife style gagets! if they can slap a phone on that thing, and get some internet access they might have a chance of taking down the crackberry too.",1,162
"very useful: i am an environmental engineer but not a wastewater treatment specialist, and have found this text very helpful. it has a good level of detail without getting excessively technical.",1,31
"this book will change your mind about war.: i recently took a class on war, and this book was used as one of the textbooks. after reading this book, my entire preception of war has changed. mr. blainey has shown me so much that i never even thought about before. not only that, but he exposes several myths about wars. for example, some people believe that wars can happen by accident. blainey even puts up a good argument for it, but in the end, he explains why that is folly. it is truly an excelent book that i would recommend to anyone interested in war.",1,105
"fun read: the contest is both cheesey and engrossing. it reads like a michael crichton novel and smacks of a blockbuster movie with way too many cgi characters in our future. despite that, however, the contest is a highly enjoyable read, though the premise of hardly believable. but if you're looking for a good book to curl up with on a rainy day - or something to take with you to the beach this summer - the contest is definitely a book worth checking out. suspend your reality for a day, and give it a try. however, i'll take a moment to mention this is the only matthew reilly novel i would recommend. i attempted to read his other novels after reading this one and found them all to be stale and boring.",1,133

"a perfect plan - almost: claudia and ben are the perfect couple. successful and happily married they have decided that they don't wish to have children. things go awry when one of this happy twosome realizes that maybe they do want children after all.what happens to a couple who make a commitment to each other and one has a change of heart makes for an interesting look at the changes we are and aren't willing to make for love. without getting too sentimental or strident on either side of the question, giffen presents a funny, poignant and believable look at what makes us choose our paths, and how we rationalize our choices.",1,112
"very good: i thought this encyclopedia was a very well written and informative. its easy to just look up a character, vehicle, droid, etc and read about it. however, it needs to be updated, since, for example, mara jade is still mara jade and not mj skywalker. i'd also like to see episode 1 characters in it, too. i hope sansweet is able to update it, because i'll definitely buy it.",1,71
"funny, funny, funny: i was unsure of this movie when i got, because of the name (i have never seen the cartoon before). however this movie exceeded my expectations. my children (3&5)love it, i liked it too. it is a hilarious show. one of my boys won't sit still long enough to watch anything, but he will watch this whole dvd. i am pretty sure they have watched it everyday for a week. i don't mind, it is great entertainment for the whole family, and at a price everyone can afford.",1,91
"the best defense of moral realism: i recommend david o.brink, _moral realism and the foundations of ethics_ (cambridge up, 1989). in my judgment it is the best defense of moral realism. although it does not deal with religion directly it argues for an objective naturalistic ethics--just what theists say that atheists cannot have.michael martin",1,54

"best game for psp...period!!!: this game looked cool in the advertisements, and i'd never played the console version, so i bought it with my christmas money. it is the best psp game i have, and i have at least 10, and have played many more. the controls are awesome, the storyline and characters are classic, and overall it feels like you're playing a classic western film as clint eastwood or john wayne. the details get pretty gorey, though, with brain splatter, blood squirting, and dismemberment, so it's not for the faint of heart. the one thing that could be better is the length of the game. it's definately not short, but if you added several more hours worth of story and a dozen more bounty missions or so, then it would be perfect.",1,133
"an american view of a very british institution: the traditional boys' preparatory school, a sort of 'mini-public school' which prepares boys for entry to proper public schools at the age of 13, is a very british institution, so it came as a surprise to this english reader to find that this book was published in washington dc. however, the american perspective upon the subject provided by the authors is to be welcomed. also welcome are the numerous photographs, beautifully capturing an educational ethos which is now, somewhat sadly, in decline. the limited number of stunning colour plates show how even more impressive the book would be if printed throughout in colour. however, considering the modest price of the book one must not grumble too much: there is much here to reward the mind and delight the eye.",1,137
"high quality cd-r media! (duh): i bought these after buying tdk for the past 5 years and now only being able to get memorex at a low price (i've had very bad experiences with memorex cdrs in the past). these were surprisingly cheap as verbatim is one of the highest quality blank media brands. not surprisingly, the discs lived up to expectations on my plextor-716a drive. i haven't tested a whole lot yet, but the ones i did test, burn flawlessly and when disc scans were run, there were no errors. you really can't go wrong with verbatim. just buy them.",1,101

"beauty in serendipity . . . a truly remarkable film.: this is a work of staggering beauty. anderson has painted a dizzying panorama of the human condition. the performances are all top-notch, including career-best work from julianna moore, tom cruise and the late, great jason robards. but amidst the flurry of brilliant acting lies an absolute gem of a screenplay, one of the best-written and most beautifully executed pieces of storytelling this viewer has ever had the good fortune to experience.the dvd version of this film is a real treat, loaded with great extras (on two discs.) a must for any serious dvd collector.",1,104

"toto - circa 1980's: i picked this cd up years ago because it was a good mix of toto material to have in the context of a single cd. now with ipods and players similar to them, having a single cd of great hits is not as necessary. it's still a great cd to have if you're a collector of toto stuff.",1,62

a great dvd!: i recently bought the dvd version of this and i find it amazing. i have only been a wrestling fan for the past 2 years now and this dvd showed a lot of the old matches that i had never seen. it had a lot of history for some of the wwf superstars and highlights of their careers and their rise to stardom. defiantly a must buy item for any wwf fan.,1,75
"great gameplay, poor documentation: this game really deserves a 5 but lack of documentation and some clunky user interfaces makes it fall short. the gameplay and graphics are quite well done and make this a great addition to any naval gamers collection. you will be left having to figure some things out for yourself as the documentation merely hints at some fo the features in the game but after a little bit of playing around you will discover these. most are in the ""on base"" portion of the game and therefore don't distract from the actual gameplay itself.i wish i would have purchased this sooner - it's a lot of fun to play.",1,113
"sm strikes again!: the sailor moon r movie is great, it tells a moonie more about the past of mamo-chan, and usagi. still has the same fights between chibi-usa, rei, and usagi over darrien, and has the same great battles. only thing i found wrong was how it was the same old same old and needed just alittle more info in the story line. over-all i thought it was great and think its a must have for a true moonie.",1,80

"ancient lights: the watchman diaries: when is the sequel coming out! although this is not ralph's first novel or non-fiction writing, it is by far his best! compared to the left behind series, a series more designed for readers who are familiar with eschatology, ancient lights takes the reader from a place of perhaps knowing very little about the bible, eschatology and the study of end times to a place of searching the bible to learn more. ancient lights held my interest from beginning to end...in fact, i did not want it to end, and can't wait for the sequel! a must read!",1,103
"if only...: all our busy families occasionally took time to just enjoy each other's company. this simple, yet inspiring, read aloud will make children yearn for days just like that and, hopefully prompt harried moms and dads to take time to savor the families they've created. the delightful verse of the story comes joyfully to life with bright, fun, water-colored illustrations. this is a book to read over and over.",1,70

"sturdy, easy to use: this is a really good solution to the litterbox scooping problem. it really works just as described. it's made out of sturdy plastic, and was easy to assemble - it took just a few minutes. very easy to use. roll it over, roll it back, pull out the drawer, empty the clumps and solid waste into a waste container, replace the drawer, tilt it to the left a bit to level the litter, then add a couple of scoops of fresh litter. it takes literally less than a minute. my cats seem to like it, and it keeps the litter inside the box - one of my cats is an enthusiastic litter-kicker, and usually scatters litter on the floor around an open litter box.i recommend this very highly.",1,132
"i absolutely love this movie!: ever since i saw this movie i have loved it! my friend and i rented it one night and have loved it ever since. i love the plot. basically, a cat named mewsette(judy garland) leaves her devoted friend, jeane tom, and her home on the farm. she wants to go to paris. when she gets there, she is tricked by the bad guy, meowrice. jeane tom and his buddy robespierre spend most of the movie looking for mewsette. i won't tell you any more because that would spoil it. this movie is absolutely hilarious! i find myself rolling every time i watch it! the only thing i don't like about it is when meowrice sings. aaah! it is really wierd. i wish they would change the title, though. well, times have changed and you don't want kids running around saying ""gay purr-ee."" other wise, it is a great movie!",1,154
"kreskin's paradox: about thirty years ago i read the great book on hypnosis by lewis wolberg [hypnosis, is it for you?] and thought i knew just about everthing on the subject. shortly afterwards i read kreskin's book and he took the whole subject a giant leap forward. this is especially interesting as kreskin says there's no such thing as hypnosis! sound strange? the solution to this paradox is one of the reasons this book is so worth reading. when a book stays in your mind for thirty years, that's some indication of it's quality.",1,94
"painless vocabulary: i like the way this book is organized - as the title indicates, by theme. i am not more enthusiastic only because my vocabulary level is just a bit beyond the one presented. for someone who has studied german only a few years, i think this could be a nice supplemental source.",1,54

"they have done it again: flash 5 - director games: where will they go next. granted the books by epic software and kris jamsa are a bit more expensive than the rest of the books, but well worth it. i bought the book so that i may see and learn how others are using their creativity to do games. glad i bought this book. it has a great deal of code and actually walks you through them. sometimes it can get difficult to follow, but it makes me just that much better when i get through it. i have already been able to sell the concept to a client and used one of the games from the book, changed some of the graphics, just a little of the code and i now have a finished piece that i can sell. awesome job, awesome book and awesome games.this book is not geared for the starters, but trust me, you will learn a great deal from this book if you are just starting out. i have been working with macromedia products for a couple of years and am glad i added these two books to my arsenal.",1,195

"fascianting...and so different to what i expected: a fascinating book, wonderfully written, that was completely different to anything i expected. hard and harsh, yet at the same time full of hope and joy, however hidden these may be by the struggles the plague brings to an english village.",1,48
"wonderful masterpiece....: the best movie chronicling the life of a composer i have seen to date. except, the storyline involving salieri's connection to mozart's death, isn't exactly factual, it was clever to assume so. tom hulce as mozart gives a breathtaking performance. he becomes the character. i loved his crazy laugh! this is definitely a movie to see - it was quite epic for me.",1,65
"almost perfect: great book, and i am looking for more from this person. it was easy to read and understand the characters",1,22
"hard to say if it's the 2nd or 3rd best: if you really look at it, ""adventures on file island"" is hard to decide if it's 2nd or 3rd best because it has a good introduction to digimon, but this book dosen't have all that digimon vol. 1 has. it's still good though, if you read it and thnik overall about the action. this isn't the best one, but if i were you i'd read it.",1,76
"only 6 episodes but worth getting: people will argue which version of the office is better, some will side with the uk version and some will side with the us version. if you were smart, you'd equally enjoy both of them. the dvd itself may be a bit expensive for only 6 episodes but the deleted scenes equal up to almost an hours worth of footage. each of these episodes are cut at around 30-34 minutes, but when they air on nbc only 21 minutes can be shown. so these deleted scenes are just basic ""extra"" scenes... they're actually as funny as the regular show... so it's a great bonus. you really need to get this dvd, because you'll be playing it over and over again.",1,126
"much better than epson: had a epson c80 printer for 3 years. in my opinion the epson is a crumby product with crumby design. i got the canon when the epson refused to print at all. i should have chucked the epson much earlier as the canon is soooo much better (won't try to print when output tray closed, has 150 sheet enclosed paper compartment as well as top loader, prints both sides, ...)",1,74

"intimate mozart: i am fairly familiar with mozart's symphonies, operas and string quartets, but these recordings were something new: the interplay of the two musicians on these complex, but accessible compositions welcomes repeated listenings. after a month, my favorite is the k.378, but there is much, so much here.",1,49

excellent for your insurance education.: i loved this text. i think it is one of the most comprehensive texts in life insurance today.,1,23
"best new artist: i think it unfair to ms. keyes that anyone would compare her to res, who is so much more womanly and connected to her musical style than alicia. the res debut is more cohesive, weaving lyrics and production into a nearly seamless cloth. even the track listing seems ordered to further your listening pleasure. aside from the bonus track, which i have to be in the mood for, ""how i do"" is very much a plug-and-play cd, in contrast to the highly skippable and aptly-titled ""songs in a minor"". with alicia, much as with aaliyah, there is a disjoint between her startling vocal ability and her production, in alicia's case an underdeveloped over-synthesized jangle that does nothing to compliment her behind the piano. alicia's debut is teeny-bop pop and does not reach me on an adult level.i recommend buying res now and giving alicia a little time to grow up.",1,153
"better than the first....: i was surprised at just how good this movie was! i am really glad that they turned it into more of a political and psychological thriller instead of just us having to watch alice and co. run around killing mindless zombies. i really liked the underlying political statements that were made concerning corporations and media control. this flick is great for those seeking a slightly more ""intellectual"" movie, and for those who simply want to sit back in their stadium seats with some buttered popcorn and have a good time. i hope the next one will be even better....",1,103

love it!: i love this wine cooler. prior to buying this wine cooler my wine was stored in cardboard boxes in the spare bedroom. this wine cooler is beautiful. stainless steel door frame and black body make this wine cooler look sleek and elegant. it is so small it hardley takes up any space which is good because i live in a tiny 1000 sq ft condo. the fan is totally silent. i never hear it running. why did i wait so long to buy it?the cooler only cools to 54 f. so white wines will still have to be chilled before drinking. the maximum ambient temperature for this wine cooler is 77 f. so it cannot be placed in a garage. the door opens from left to right. i am not sure it can be reversed like with refrigerators. one final drawback - champagne bottles will not fit unless a rack is removed.all in all a great bargin.,1,159

"what an a amazing album: i can hardly begin to describe what this album means to me. her voice is one thing, but her emotion is another. i believe that this women is up there with the few in the music industry who are really artist. i believe that it takes a lot of courage to put your self on the line emotionally the way sarah does. every song on this cd is one masterpiece after the other. intense lyrics, perfectly tuned voice, and incredible emotion all lye within this brilliant work on musical art.",1,95
"great sound, messy to fold away: had these for 3 years and my kid wants a set as well. price has almost tripled!the sound is brilliant and they sit nicely around my brain.only gripe is folding them back into the strange carry case. a simple pouch would be better.another reviewer went through 3 sets in less than 2 years but mine are pretty robust and have survived my kids abuse of them.",1,72
"a helpful introduction to benner's short-term model: dr. david benner presents the case for his short-term, five-session model for pastoral counseling with succinctness, clarity, fairness, and sound argumentation. in addition, he goes to great lengths to explain how such a model could work effectively within a church setting. the last three chapters are especially practical in their step-by-step presentations of the strategic pastoral counseling model and two well-presented case studies. his discussion of the inherently spiritual nature of many life issues (pp.62-67) is a very helpful and profound elucidation of the pastoral counselor's role. i highly recommend this volume to all pastors of local churches and all practicing or aspiring christian counselors.",1,112
the taste is everlasting: for a group to be admired through classical musical is great. although a much different feel without the electricity included it still rocks. maybe after a rough day at work and looking to not have to focus on lyrics this would be a great alternative. just let your mind explode and feel the sonic aura that is mastodon being done with brass and winds. this is a very good cd and don't pass it up,1,79

"great book, now updated: i read this book when it came out and loved it. the near future chicago setting is fantastic. it's an exciting read. great detective story. i searched google for richard engling to see what he's done lately and found his web site. engling is giving body mortgage away on his web site in a couple of ebook formats, including for pdas, and he's revised and updated it.

"gripping crime thriller....: this is the original smash-hit hong kong inspiration for ""the departed""...only 50 times better. an absolute must see. tony leung is great in this and even the often stiff andy lau deserves some credit. anthony wong chau-sang and the always energetic eric tsang both take the cake for their superb acting.one thing that just irked me is the hot chick on the cover of the miramax re-release of the dvd. that piece of arse is none other than elva hsiao (or siu if you prefer cantonese). she's a famous taiwanese singer and *snicker ahem* ""actress"". elva was in the movie for no more than a total of 5 minutes. then why is she on the cover? hey, sex sells. slap a hot girl on the cover of anything and it'll sell. only problem is, ""infernal affairs"" is an awesome movie that has nothing to do with sex and stands in its own right.",1,156

"a classic! (but just don't mind the cover art!): altough it possess one of the worst covers ever for a metal album, there is no denial that stay hungry is a gem of hard rock / metal.the trick here is that twisted sister, even with the long hair and snider's eyelid and makeup, was not a typical hair metal band. their lyrics were better, the attitude somewhat different, the musicianship also better and harder. of course they profited over the whole mtv videos vibe of the time, but that was a natural course to follow, unfortunately.stay hungry is one hell of a strong album. the nine songs are good, there is no throaway. it's not a masterpiece by any standard, but it's simply very good.",1,125
"works very well: we used this vacuum to pick up drywall dust from our subfloor. it is a great vacuum and does an excellent job. however we had to get a replacement after about a month because1. the hose broke - not due to anyone stepping on it, but it separated from the edge connector.2. the electric on/off switch gave a shock during heavy loads.3. one of the wheels came off during handling. had to rescrew it back in.we got a replacement as it cleans very well. also apart from the above problems, the construction is solid, easy to clean and replace the bags. you definitely need the love-less 131-41 vacuum bags with this.",1,114

"sexy, mysterious, elegant: the romance is surprising, tender, and exciting; the story keeps you guessing until the last few pages. the drama and mystery make it seem more like a thriller than a romance novel, which make the romantic scenes even better when they show up. she is smart and independant; he is strong, clever, witty, and charming without being too rehearsed.",1,62

"just as great as the tv show: the music that plays on the oc is just as important as the dialog the characters speak themsleves. it sets a mood, it furthers a storyline, it can make a feeling. the music on the oc does just that and it is wonderful to boot. there is not one song on this cd that i can't listen to, again and again.",1,68
"who can resist the saint?: roger moore is at his finest in this series. his true personality shines with zinging one-liners, and of course, what red- or blue-blooded female can resist his amazing good looks!but seriously, these stories are set in the top globe-trotting sites on the planet in the 1960's, which brings back such retro nostalgia. the scenery and colors, the camera angles, have those new(at the time) 60's camera angles, some reminiscent of the american series ""batman"". the stories themselves are very well-written and the adaptations for television are first-rate.if, like me, you're sick and tired of television programmes today which offer a buffet of violence and sex, with nothing left to the imagination, then i urge you to buy this dvd set and enjoy television from a time when good manners were included, ladies wore hats and gloves to go out and about, and the cars were tres cool.",1,152

"this stuff actually works!: i wouldn't have thought it if i hadn't tried it, but this stuff actually works. i started taking it about a day after i started experiencing cold symptoms. my symptoms got only a little worse, much less than they normally do when i get a cold, and then i was feeling better within a couple of days. i really didn't think it would work as well as it did.the active ingredients are vitamin c (60% rda), zinc (50% rda), echinacea, eucalyptus, and stevia. other ingredients are peppermint, licorice, roasted chicory, natural menthol extract, lavender and chinese star anise. the taste is okay, but i prefer it warm with a bit stevia and vanilla-flavored almond milk. i imagine it would also taste good with honey. three cups a day, and my symptoms went away. i didn't really think it possible before, but i do now.",1,148

"music for the millenium: as the millenium approaches, music must prepare itself for the inevitable change of the ages. and with those changes there must be a new force to spearhead the change. this force has a name and it's tommy henriksen. from the worldly sounds and hip-hop beat of the opening track ""if i could"", to the atmospheric and emotion-drenched ender ""heaven only knows"" this cd is the soundtrack to a culture in metamorphosis. but all the while maintaining a fresh pop sensibility, the songs are just so damn catchy- try getting them out of your head. quite a feat, and especially for a new artist. where has this guy been? suggested tracks for surreal ear candy, the blissful ""beyond life"" [with cameo by avant-rocker nina hagen], ""dreaming in colors"", and the african chant-anthem ""uneasy street"". then for an upbeat flavor is the celtic-fueled ""one voice"", and the seductive stirrings of ""when she comes"". this is an absolute must!",1,160
"education for extenction: education for extinction is a book about the boarding school experience of american indians. the book is one that will bring you to tears, but it also shows the incredible resiliency of the children who endured the boarding school experience. this book is a true portrayal of the boarding school experience; the good, the bad, and the ugly. this book gives you a harsh look at why indian boarding schools were created in the first place and the connection between american exceptionalism and colonization. i recommend this book if you are willing to take a harsh look at the oppression of american indians.",1,106

"considering the price, these are fantastic!: when my good headphones got broken, i needed a quick and cheap fix until i could afford some more high quality ones. i'm not a fan of ear buds, but after reading reviews here i decided to pick a pair of these up. i am not disappointed.despite their size and price tag, these ear buds pack quite a punch. i was downright amazed by the sound quality, which is simply incredible. for under ten dollars, you can't get better sound. also, the winding case is a very nice touch. i can keep my headphones from getting tangled, and it only takes about five seconds to get them back in the case.my only real gripes are that the cord is only a meter, far too short if you want to have any freedom of movement when listening. also, they pop out of your ears too easily, especially because they're short. however, such a problem is minor considering the price and quality of these ear buds.",1,170

"hmmmm...: since there was a series of albums in the early 1960s, all with the same title (""a meiga elizete""), it would be great if the song titles were included, so potential customers could know which record they would be getting. i've heard the first album in the series (which has ""vai querer"" and ""projecao"" as the first two tracks...) and it is quite nice!",1,65
"can't imagine a better performance!: i am clearly an amatuer regarding such matters, but i have never for a second regretted purchasing this set and find the performances and the recordings to be flawless. the choral fantasy was an unexpected bonus. i was not familiar with it when i bought this set, but now it is one of my favorites.i can't imagine anyone not being pleased with these recordings.",1,69

"basic leadership principles with excellent examples: this book was an enjoyable, practical and applicable read. phillips outlines a number of basic leadership principles and uses relevant examples from abraham lincoln's time as commander in chief during the civil war. this book will be enjoyable both for lincoln fans and those looking for basic concepts of leadership.the book is broken down into four areas: people, character, endeavor, and communication with sub-chapters that further support each area. each sub-chapter is synopsized with summary bullets called ""lincoln principles"" that highlight the cogent thoughts of that section.""lincoln on leadership"" is a good primer to provide a basic overview of leadership principles, and will not be useful for teaching about advanced leadership topics. however, phillips' use of relevant examples from lincoln's life made the book applicable to a number of leadership scenarios and made this book very enjoyable.",1,143

"quite a good movie: i think that just like all sequels, this one will inevitably be compared with the original exorcist. frankly, i think it's actually a pretty good movie. skaarsgard does make a pretty convincing younger version of father merrin, some 25 years before the events in the first exorcist, and like father karras, has his own crisis of faith from his wwii days as a priest in nazi europe. as mentioned by others, some of the cgi effects could be better (the hyeanas, the sandstorm), but overall i did enjoy this movie and would recommend it.",1,98
"probably the scariest pirate story ever: i was not expecting much when i started to read this book. i have a mostly unfounded fascination for contemporary cultural images of piracy, and i wanted to get this under my belt to earn a little street cred. turns out, it's amazing. it took me a couple of chapters to pick up the rhythm and vocabulary of stevenson's style, but once i was able to focus on the story itself, i didn't want it to end. stevenson does a brilliant job of portraying pirates for the criminals that they were, mostly by viewing them through the eyes of an innocent young boy, who overhears a dark conversation while hiding in an apple barrel and also spends a tense scene trying to escape his home with his mother before the bad guys materialize out of the misty night to kill them both for treasure. the book is scary, with some real surprises and well-developed characters, and i loved it.",1,165

"cit 400 good option but some: i've bought this one based upon reviews that i've read here at amazon. i liked the product very much, despite i thought it was a pure wi-fi phone and it would work with my actual apple's aiport extreme base station without needing to install anything else. unfortunately it didn't and i had to install linksys own antenna too.than i needed to go after a spare rj-45 cable + an ethernet switch-hub to connect it to airport extreme2nd thing is that when you got the product's handset on it's base for recharging, it's screen keep all the time back-lighted. no way to turn it off.beyond that, the product works fine and i recommend it.",1,119
"trapse around paris with hemingway!: hemingway is one of my favorite novelists. fortunately, he is as terrific a non-fiction writer as he is a fiction writer.he shows you a paris that was so full of life, and opportunity; you can immediately see why american writers flocked there in droves in the twenties.in this book, the writing is so good that you feel that you are drinking in the quaint parisian bars until all hours, and that you, too, are drinking in all the sights and scenes of the most inspiring city in the world at that time.also, from his friendship with gertrude stein to the guilt he felt after an adulterous affair, hemingway holds back nothing.for two years i lived in oak park, il, where hemingway was born and raised. the community has made the house he lived in a museum honoring him, and holds a hemingway festival. i sorely miss living there; it certainly isn't paris back in hemingway's time (what is?!)but it is wonderful to have a museum to such an adventurous american writer.",1,176

"the lost performance: i received my dvd from mike pinder's website. early and signed by him. it is a great dvd. i was not able to see them during the 60s and 70s. so it is nice to see what they looked and sounded like. you can't put today's standards onto something that was done in the 70s. so if you are looking for a concert as it would be recorded today, than you would be disappointed. i on the otherhand thoroughly enjoy watching it. even with all of its flaws. so if you are a true fan, you will want to own this dvd.",1,105
"kool game!!!: in this game you will find many twists! in what may seem to be a peaceful cargo deliverly to the rebels may include a visit by a star destroyer!! you must be on your toes for this game. and if you don't like fling a freighter in a wave of tie fighters, too bad!!!",1,56
"it's the best!: originally i had the aluminum cups that were not double lined and they did not keep anything cold and all they did was sweat all over everything. we were going to hawaii and i knew i just had to find a better solution. so i gave these a try. omg!!! the are the best cup ever. we would put water, soda, flavored water - whatever - in the cup in the morning with some ice. then drive around all day and leave the cups in a car that was over 100 degrees and by the end of the day the beverage was still ice cold and the ice had not even melted all the way. absolutely amazing. you just can't go wrong. easy to drink from, no sweating - it is perfect. i am keeping these babies under lock and key when our son comes over and wanders off with the hodge-podge of cups and glasses we have, never to be seen again.",1,166
"small but well designed: this is one of the smaller brita pitchers. every morning, after water for the cat, the dog, and my pills, it needs a refill. the great part is, no need to remove the top to add water. a small section of the lid tilts up for refills. no fingerprints, no smudges, no problems. it is small enough to fit anywhere in the refrigerator, door or shelf. who cares about continuous refills is you don't have to remove the lid and then clean the mess.also a really easy to use calendar to keep track of 8 weeks between filter changes.",1,103

"mach ii never fails: let me make this plain and clear. this is a classic mach ii deep purple cd. that being said, if you like in rock, fireball, machine head, who do we think we are?, perfect strangers and house of the blue light then you will love this cd. the lyrics are clever, the guitar is classic blackmore and the rhythm section of paice, lord and glover is as solid as ever. the production is crisp and what more do you need? never get tired of listening to anya, twist in the tale, ramshackle man and nasty piece of work. nothing wrong with the other tracks *(except one man's meat) either. with the garbage that passes as rock these days you owe it to yourself to hear some ""real"" rock gods. deep purple mach ii are among the best. i promise you won't be disappointed.",1,147
"still going strong one and a half years later!: i bought this as a gift for my daughter, who at the time was just about to turn 3. from day one she has loved it! i can honestly say that she would not love learning as much as she does now if it weren't for the leappad!the purple and pink was a great idea from the manufacturer, she was barely interested in the green and blue.in addition to the leappad, the organizers and books make it a tight system. it's very difficult to lose cartridges with the organizer.it's also very stable, it's been dropped, hanged (by the pen/cord), written on and rained on and it's still working flawlessly. the pages are laminated so they don't get damaged or torn either!overall this is the best purchase i've made for my daughter yet. if you want your child reading and doing math quickly and having fun while learning, get this now!",1,159
"awesome book ever made!: i just got this book as a christmas present. i think it's the best dictionary ever! i now know how to speak a few phrases in klingon, but i'm still learning to speak more phrases of the language to myself. if you don't have this book, get it now. it's the best book that'll help you learn the basics and all the grammar of the language of the klingon empire. i rate this book 5x2 stars. it's the best klingon dictionary okrand ever made! buy it and you'll learn the greatest language of the empire! qapla'!",1,100

"great debut, very under-rated as far as radio goes...: i have all 3 of chris's albums, all are great, but i'm just surprised i've never heard much if anything from this one on radio. good album all the way through but some of my favorites are ""beer or gasoline"", ""burn"", ""drinking me lonely"", and ""small town big time"". i would highly recomend all of his albums, he's true country and that's hard to find in today's pop and rock based country trends...",1,82
"good advice, if you can follow it: there are things here about the psychology of people who are shy, different kinds of shyness, some root causes, things you can do about it, how to not raise shy kids, and some benefits of being shy (e.g. tend to do good work that would be hard for flighty or gregarious people -- intense research, etc.)the co-author is a psychologist or psychiatrist, and probably contributed the theories.my only complaint was that being shy was occasionally refered to as selfishness in other clothes.all in all, there is some good advice but it didn't change my life or anything.",1,104
"very nice pen set: let me say first up, if you're looking for a professional pen set, look somewhere else. that aside, this is a pretty good amateur set.this pen set comes with 8 assorted pens, as advertised. one is a ""thin"" felt tip (thicker then most ball tip pens), a medium felt tip pen, and 6 marker tip pens, which are only different from each other thanks to the ink tone, which ranges from light gray to pure india ink black.if you're not used to drawing with pens, this is a great set to start out with. practice a bit, and you'll be making some fine art in no time. if you're more on the experienced side, well, you don't really need me to tell you what to do.haven't been able to tell if they're refillable or not. the back end rotates, but i'm too scared of making a huge mess to try to pull it off. guess i'll find out when the ink runs out in one of them, but this is a great value either way.",1,179

baps are here to stay!: this book is a great humorous expose! as a older almost retired bap i can see we successfully passed down our way of life. only the brand names have changed! i laughed and i gave it as gifts to several in the next generation.,1,49
"michelle....you go gurl!!!: i had the pleasure, blessing and the privelage to meet and hear the wonderful vessel of god speak at my church's women's season recruitment night and it was truly a blessing. this is what the co-pastor at my church is using in her women's season bible study. michelle is such an awesome author because she is so serious about being an instrument of righteousness for the lord and she basically is saying in this book that if you want to be blessed and highly favored in the sight of our heavenly father than you have to seek him early, seek him reverently, seek him prayerfully and seek him as if nothing else on earth really matters. this book lets you know that those of us who half step with the lord as far as being in his will , will always be half blessed. i strongly recommend all of her books. michelle, i thank god for you and your ministry and continue to be blessed and highly favored.",1,171

"love yourself!: in her novel, ""wait for love,"" wanda hudson explores the evolution of one woman blinded by the idea of love - ""i gave into any and everything a man wanted. my life's mission was to have one and make him happy even if i wasn't.""the protagonist, lynnde, spends her young adulthood in pursuit of love. with a single-minded determination, lynnde manages to go from one bad relationship (i use the term lightly!) to the next, only finding solace in food. as her emotions run the gamut, so does her weight. will lynnde ever find the love she so desperately wants?there is no denying that hudson knows how to draw readers into a story. i can't tell you how many times i wanted to jump into the pages of this book to either hug or hurt lynnde. hudson weaves a story that is both fresh and familiar. i enjoyed ""wait for love"" and look forward to reading more from this author.",1,162
great comedian: the package arrived on time and great condition. the dvd itself was amazing. i was laughing the entire hour the show was going for. dimitri martin is probably my favorite comedian.,1,33
"made for a smaller waisted dog than mine.: this is a very nice sweater, but it was too small for my dog even though i measured him for the sweater. it was long enough, but too small around the waist. i gave it to my sister for her dog though, and it fit her dog perfectly. i have a mid-sized maltese, she has a poodle.",1,65
"looks good but is smaller than i anticipated: i bought this to carry a couple of tools on my motorized bicycle. it looked the part for the old school look i was going for.it is smaller than i anticipated, but that is because i didn't pay close attention to the description.it looks great on the back of the saddle or on the handle bar and holds what i need for a quick fix.",1,73

"magnificent sampler of rilke's poems: bly chooses poems from a number of rilke's books, prefacing the poems with a brief background of where rilke was (physically and emotionally) when he wrote each book. the original german is displayed opposite bly's translations; you can get a sense of what got ""lost in translation"" even if, like myself, you don't speak a word of german.bly's ruthless honesty shines through every page of the book. though his translations are incredibly luminous, he clearly admits their limits:""...rilke's elaborate and thoroughgoing labor on sound cannot be conveyed. in english his poems sound colorless. i've tried for ten years to get the last three lines of ""october day"" right, with their lonely sound of blowing leaves and their pride in solitude, but i can't do it...""if this fragment doesn't sell the book to you, i don't know what will!",1,143
good books not quite long enough.: the books were very well written but they just were not long enough. it is a great way to spend about 2 hours a weekend afternoon. it takes about an hour to read each. still wonderfully written and the money goes to a great cause.,1,51
"aunt irma gives it two thumbs up!: normally, you have to appreciate british humor to watch these kind of shows. the it crowd is pretty much a combination of dilbert and office space that delivers alot of dry humor. if you work in it... you must watch this show.",1,49
"collector's castle: i am a my little pony collector, in college. i admit, i am a little predjudiced, but i love this castle. my parents bought it for me for christmas, and although it took forever to get all the little stickers on, i haven't has a problem getting this toy to stay together. it spends the majority of its time on a shelf, but it does get some play from my friends' kids. the balconies and such seem to be made to ""break away"" and fall apart rather than actually snap off, but the kids seem to learn real quick how to put it back together. based on other reviews though, i suspect that hasbro released this toy a little too early, without a decent amount on consumer testing. i also have the cotton candy cafe and the celebration salon, and those stay together wonderfully.",1,146
stupid but funny: i bought two of these for gag gifts this year and both people loved them. i laughed out loud multiple times.( we played the cd 3 times during xmas ). really low brow humor but well done. basically just various bodily noises along with various xmas / holiday songs. no vocals.,1,54
"one of my favorites!: nine months is an adorably funny movie seen through the eyes of a terrified father to be (hugh grant). robin williams is hilarious as the couple's russian doctor. joan cusack and tom arnold are superb as the ""breeder"" couple that helps them through this changing time. julianne moore shines as the expectant mommy. an all around heartwarming and funny movie. the end will have you rolling on the floor holding your stomach with laughter.",1,78
"outstanding drill!: i was given two of these for christmas and love them. i run a small community theater and we are tough on tools, especially cordless drills. since christmas these drills have been dropped from ladders, used to drive way to many 3"" screws and built 2 full sets and there is not a single complaint. they hold a charge and recharge fast, the torque is great and the raw power is wonderful. the built in light is such a wonderful bonus i now want all of the drills to have them. simple to say we are buying more of these.",1,102

great alterpieces:gotic and renaissance: fantastic book on the subject.the altarpieces are shown in their integrity wich is difficult to see even when youvisitthe different churches were the altarpieces are preserved.the texts are a little bit cold and the whole book very heavy to consult.,1,44
trip back in time: this was a trip back in time. i always liked the dobbies but had forgotten how much. nice extended jams on some songs. good song selection and being a drummer some nice playing.,1,37
"torn: i found the voice of the narrator and easy flow of thought to be not only phenomenally crafted but engaging in a way many books fail to ever achieve. both tina and evelyn are great, heart wrenching characters and every success and failure feels like a direct reflection upon a secret life only you know you ever lived. however, despite this being such an amazingly written book i was frustrated to find that the ending felt like there was something more that should have been written but somehow had been forgotten during publishing. this could possibly just be my own feelings and i still highly recommend this read. i look forward to reading her other books and maybe down the road she'll revisit evelyn and tina and hopefully things will have continued looking up for them.",1,137

"versatile and enduring: if you love to cook, this is an indispensible piece of cookware. from stovetop to oven, this is a high level tool. if you can deal with the weight of cast iron, which is considerable and part of the charm, the enamel cooking surface is perfect for browning and braising, among other things. an excellent product that will last forever if you treat it well (like don't ever use metal utensils which scratch off the enamel).",1,79
"wow what a fence!: i've owned the dewalt since it first came out. so far i haven't had any trouble with it. i cut oak, walnut, etc. without any problems. this isn't a cabinet saw, so don't expect it to cut through thick materials all day. it works fine for about anything else. the miter that came with the saw is pretty cheap, i replaced it with a better one. my only complaint with the saw is that the blade is so close to the front edge that it makes cross-cuts on anything wider than 4 or 5 inches a hassle. it does have the best fence adjustment system that i have ever used. after you have used the dewalt rack&pinion fence system you won't want to use anything else. my advice...if this is your only saw save your money and buy a bigger more powerful one like the delta platinum. if you lack space or need portability, this is a nice saw.",1,163
"wow, i'm impressed: i had owned for several years a kenmore dehumidifier. it was so loud it literally roared and you could feel it vibrating the floor upstairs. it did it's job, but it ran constantly and i'm sure was a total electricity hog.i got my new goldstar refurbished, in the original box, well packed and ready to just plug in.i turned it on and all i can say is wow. this thing is whisper quiet. the blower on my furnace makes 20x more noise than this thing does. i set the humistat at the midway point and walked away. less than 20 hours later, i noticed it was dutifully shut off and waiting for me to empty the bucket. no overflows. the bucket has a great handle on it that makes it super easy to carry with no splashing. the unit itself is on casters and moves around with one finger.i am very pleased with this unit and would definitely recommend it.",1,163
"great no spill mug.: i have been using this mug for about 3 months now. i really like it alot although there are just one concern... the rubber o-ring on the lid that is essentially the spill proofing comes off the lid very easily if you are not careful when hand washing, therefore allowing your beverage to spill all over your car seat as it did mine. now that i'm aware of this it hasn't been a problem since. also, the claim of 8 hours of keeping your coffee hot is not realistic unless you work in a heated area. if you work in the cold it will go for about 2 or 2- 1/2 hours. the one thing that i didn't like before ordering is that it is only 16oz. however, what i have found is that now my coffee is staying very hot for a longer period is that i drink it slower & the 16oz is sufficient. overall it is the best mug i have owned & would definately recommend!",1,173
best book in ages!: harry potter and the sorcerer's stone is the best book you could ask for on a wish list. it's exciting and supspenseful and a book i could have the joy of reading again feeling like it was the first time reading it.,1,46
"get this one!: great stuff! i love the misfits and fifties rock and it sounds like everyone is having a ball on this one! a great time all the way through! pick this one up! by the way, the reviewer who said jerry sold the rights to a song for a vans commercial should remember that only had to give up the rights to older misfits songs to danzig in order to bring back the band so the 'sell out' in that case would not be jerry. i think the whole 'sell out' idea is inane, but wanted to clarify that. who cares about a vans ad? this is a great cd! pick up the box set to while you are at it. you can't go wrong with the misfits stuff on this site.",1,134
"sturdy and roomy: there's a good amount of heft to this safe, which leads me to think it would hold up fairly well in the event of fire. luckily, i have not had to test it's durability in fire or waterproofness (and hope i never will).there's plenty of room for several important documents and a handful of jewelry. at about 20 lbs it's not something you'd want to move around all the time.",1,73

love this polish: i love this brand of polish- its what my nail salon uses. great long-lasting nail color!! i would recommend this brand in any color.,1,27
"very interesting, but rather tabloid-y: this is an excelent chronicle of one of history's greatest climbers. because it presents both sides of the story, this book is worth a read. contains scientific data as well as multitudes of tabloid-ish material. however, because it does, it tells the whole story. marco pantani, while an outstanding athlete, was the britney spears of italian cycling. this book captures that scene well!",1,68
"excellent: the description of this item was used so i expected some wear to show on the book. the book looked brand new!! the book arrived earlier than it was indicated so thrilled about that too, didn't have to wait. absolutely wonderful experience buying from you.",1,46
"catchy tunes!: yes, she's definitely the queen of retro-dance. ""good girl"", ""favorite things"", ""kiss it all goodbye""..... are among my favorites that i used to play all the time. stacey's got a great soothing voice that just makes you feel good and want to dance, but she can do slow songs just as well. i personally like better than heaven more that hard machine, because i really liked the tracks that were not ""hits."" a great album to me is one where quality of the ""other"" songs (the ones that didn't make in the charts)add to the overall enjoyment and value (their not just ""fillers""). all in all, hard machine is a great album with catchy tunes you will enjoy!take a listen and you'll be singing along.i saw her in person back in the mid 80's........and she really puts on a show!! she faded away too soon like other artists, but i haven't forgetten about her!!",1,156

student bible dictionary: great investment for all 2 have when studying the bible. excellent resource especially the illustrations. i would recommend this student bible dictionary for all.,1,27
"a priceless investment: in a world of relativism and unbridled inclusiveness, we need a clear understanding of god's word. it is life changing. the bible does not contain but is the absolute truth of god. as one studies god's word in the original languages (in this case nt koine greek), untold treasures are revealed concerning what the lord has for those who believe. we get a better understanding of the mind of god, the value of life and the salvation that every soul needs through jesus christ. i highly recommend it.",1,91
"good tool: this a must-have tool for every kitchen. it's easy to wash, and it makes cooking anything on a cookie sheet so much easier. the only complaint i'd have is that it picks up grease from whatever you cook on it and feels quite greasy after a while. other than that, it's easy to use and quite handy.",1,59
"dark adventure to cross the sea of blood: the dl series was a huge leap forward for tsr - these modules featured a new emphasis on drama and storytelling that made the gaming much more fun and involved for the pcs and the dm. of course, at heart, being tsr modules from the 80s, they're still dungeon crawls! in this chapter, the heroes (levels 9-10) must journey across the blood sea of istar, to end the legacy of the dark queen once and for all! a glorious endquest to the epic adventure.",1,92
bad boys are good: i've read most of the bad boys books and this one goes well with all the rest. i enjoyed all three stories and i liked that they were related.,1,33
great: this item arrived on time and in good condition. the movie is a must see for those who like movies about hispanic culture,1,24
very beautiful bracelet: this watch is more an expensive bracelet then a quality watch. being a citizen eco drive and a beautiful bracelet in one and the same product and also at such a reasonable price is the best deal. recommended for every beautiful women. it is very attractive. i love this watch,1,53
"good concert dvd and cd: this was a good value, the dvd and cd combination. i thought the dvd was well shot, and i've listened to the cd quite a bit. although i was never a die-hard nazareth fan, i remember really liking the razamanaz album. the lead singer dan mccafferty hasn't lost much voice, it may have gotten a little raspier. pete agnew, the bass player has his son playing drums in the band, and the kid does play well. i may have liked manny charleton's style a little better than the guitar player they have now, but this guy holds his own, and does a good job.",1,109

"fantastic anime dvd: ""l hazard - the priestess of water""s tons of fun. i was looking for something with spoken japanese that would help me keep up on my second language. this is doing the trick, and has classic japanese animation to boot. each ""l hazard""dvd has four half-hour episodes. they take place in el hazard, which is a very colorful, imaginative (""lternative"" world. the opening and closing songs are great japanese pop songs, and the incidental music is fun and original. i'm fairly new to the anime scene, really only familiar with hayao miyazaki's features (the disney of japan, search for ""ayao miyazaki""in vhs). but i laughed and thoroughly enjoyed this one, the first in the ""l hazard""series. i plan to get the rest of the series eventually. by the way...what does ""va""mean?",1,134

"a pleasure to use and accurate: i have been using another brand of spice jar friendly spoons and only recently discovered that they were off quite a bit in the measurements. out they went and enter this amco set. i measured each and every one against a very reliable set and they were right on target. they also sit perfectly on the coutertop when filled, which is wonderful. my only complaint is that the sizes imprinted on the handle are not etched deeply enough and it is not easy to read in 4 of the 6 spoons, but that is not critical, just a little annoying.",1,106
"best of the best: there will never be nor has there been a man with his talent. the first time i heard ""borrowed angel"" i was hooked. i just purchased a 45 that has never been played of that song. he never received the recognition he deserved and that hurts me so deeply. i don't know what happened that fatal day, and now it doesn't matter. all i know is he's gone forever except in my memory where infinity is his legacy.other fans e-mail me @ gse02116@wvnet.edu as i would love to remember and reflect with those who truly care and appreciate his talent.",1,104
"the flock was unique: i picked this up on vinyl at a used record store back in the mid-70's and was blown away by the unique approach to their music via jerry goodman on violin. i never cared much for the ""horn bands"" of the early 70's, like chicago or blood, sweat & tears. however, the flock was different and had a edge to them that was quite appealing. unfortunately, the flock got little commercial exposure and usually played alot of the festivals going on at the time. the flock was more appreciated by other musicians than by the average listener. the funny thing is when people saw them live, they usally liked them. it goes to show you success is not just measured by talent or the flock would have been at the top of the ladder. the flock's style is a mixture of rock, jazz, classical & folk that creates a sound that is raw and polished at the same time. the flock is one of the best bands that never really ""made it"".",1,176
"so far so good.: i have recently purchased this tool for professional carpentry applications. it has been used for a week, with no problems and not one single misfire. the battery fits snugly and tight, the fuel cell issues must be resolved,no problems. very light tool, angle allows access to hard to reach places. the adjustable depth is an excellent addition to the original guns which did not have depth adjustment.i own the paslode straight nailer and the 18 gauge nailer for trim and we have two paslode framers.we also use pneumatic tools and trimmers and these paslodes are not the best alternative for heavy production jobs. for an additon, a kitchen, or a room remodel they are perfect.i do not think homeowners or weekend warriors should spend the money, but if you like nice tools then the whole line of paslodes are a super investment.",1,146

"love it!: i wanted to be able to use my new vac several times before reviewing and i must say i love it! the suction on this little vac is great even on my area rugs. i have hardwoods with a few area rugs and i have berber on my stairs and tile bathrooms and it does a great job on all four surfaces. granted it does best on the wood/tile floors but that is its main purpose. it is lightweight, easy to maneuver and fairly easy to clean out. it is easy to switch to carpet mode. and my hardwood floors have not been scratched at all as some reviewers state. maybe they are doing their hardwoods on the carpet mode and i could see where the bristles on the brush would scratch but not in bare floor mode. the main downfall is the short cord, i just have to plug it in for each room. i do not have a huge house (1440 sq. feet) so overheating has not been a problem. for the price and the convenience i highly recommend!",1,183
"science is simple -- with this book it is!: i just started teaching science to pre kindergarten children. this book takes a concept, breaks it down into explainable elements and then provides complimentary activies to include books, songs, fingerplay, etc. i was talking about a lesson plan in clay cafe to a friend last weekend, and a teenager nearby piped up: ""we just did that in 8th grade science."" i viewed this as a real compiment! my pre kindergarten students love the class. mothers apologize when their child is sick and cannot come! this book has been absolutely terrific! i need to see if the author has other books that she has written as well.",1,115

"one of the greatest albums of all time!!!!!!!: i first heard of these guys back in 1999 a few months after they broke up. i was sitting at home and for some reason watching mtv at 2 am. anyway the video for ""new noise"" was played and i was completely blown away by the heaviness of the band. as i sat there watching the video i realized that they had to be one of the hardest, craziest bands, with a real message that i had ever heard. i was i didn't actually buy the album until sometime in 2001 but it remains my favorite album only behind ""the clash"". if your tired of bands like rancid, nofx, and pennywise and are interested in lefty politics check this album out",1,129
"work great: a simple little item that saves a lot of caulk. i had been using other caulk tube sealers, most of them that go inside the spout. that style usually causes the spout to split and you loose the seal. others that go over the spout are made of hard plastic and don't seal well. these are soft, like rubber, and stretch tightly over the spout. they could be used to seal many other things as well.",1,78
"mr. streissguth includes unusual with expected.: mr. streissguth's work is a welcomed effort to begin someone on the path to understanding dr. franklin. though brief, mr. streissguth includes many salient points often left out of simple biographies. points include the difficulties he faced in politics, the failures he knew, the mistakes made. although written for the young reader, he writes with thoughtfulness and respect. the book never has the ""baby-talk"" voice found in some young reader books.this biography allows the reader to understand dr. franklin was a real person living in difficult times. one of the better mini-bio's on dr. franklin i have read with 98% accuracy on the details of his life and accomplishments.g.robin smith ben@ben-franklin.org",1,117

"detailed diagrams, step-by-step instructions, and more: the new birdhouse book: inspiration and instruction for building 50 birdhouses by leslie garisto is far more than just another woodworking ""how-to guide"" for a weekend project. rather it is a full blown celebration showcasing a vast variety of crafted avian housing, ranging from common box houses to pillared feeders, as well as expansive and complex creations designed especially to attract specific birds. color photography, detailed diagrams, step-by-step instructions, and more, make the new birdhouse book a must-have for woodworkers of all skill and experience levels who seek to apply their talents to the betterment of our feathered friends.",1,105
"works very well: i was surprised at how well this fm transmitter works, especially considering the low price. of the 8 stations to choose from, 3 come in crystal clear 99% of the time. my only complaint (and this isn't a very big one) is that the station numbers aren't backlit. i'm mostly in the car at night, so it's practically impossible to see what station the transmitter is on without turning on a light. but considering how well it works (and how cheap it is), this problem seems really minor.",1,91

"my cat copes with it: my cat recently was diagnosed with arthritis and this was recommended by the vet. i wouldn't say my cat loves it but he eats it with only slight hesitation when we put it on his food. (my other cat, without arthritis, has no problems with it, of course). he has not vomited because of it but i would agree with the person complaining about the squirt bottle. mine too, leaked all over the side, making a big sticky mess. besides a poor package design, the supplement has been good.",1,94
"great! but the other c.d.'s shine too!: this is not the only great c.d. from this artist. too many people have overloked his other c.d.'s this a a great album though, and my favorites are the title track, ""say your'e wrong"" which has a great melody and has been stuck in my head for 20 years, it's that catchy! i even did a varation of the lrycs myself for fun! ""space"" is a beauftiul soundscape! julian, keep making music! you are a gifted songwriter!",1,84
"don't look behind you: it's the story of a teenage girl and her family getting relocated to another town in the federal witness protection program.april corrigan, tennis champ, popular student, girlfriend of the class pesident, must leave behind all of her friends and the life she's had, after her father testifies against a company of drug dealers. a hitman is hired, and threatening letters were sent to them because of her father's involvement in this high-profile trial.i enjoyed reading this book. it took unexpecting turns, especially in the end, and had me on the edge of my seat the entire time i was reading it. this book should be read by a teen and adult audience due to violence, and some graphic language.lois duncan will pull you right into this book with discriptive writing, and exciting plot lines. it's definitly worth reading.",1,142
"fun to be ""sloppy"": a year in the life of a teenage girl named jessica darling. told dominantly through journal entries and letters, the book runs from january to december, following jessica's life after her best friend hope moves away. now she hangs out at school with three girls she really doesn't like, fights a crush on a drug-loving boy, and simply tries to make it from one day to the next. this is a cute debut from megan mccafferty that will certainly appeal to adults who have survived the high school experience and to the teens who are currently living it. if you like a light comedy, if you liked the princess diaries or angus, thongs and full frontal snogging, you'll enjoy sloppy firsts.",1,125
"all quiet on the western front: i am a student at walla walla high school. i chose to read all quiet on the western front by erich remarque, in my senior english class. i think everbody should read this book, just becuase it is a story of an average soilder and how they live. people watch televsion and think war is that way, but when you get on the front line it is totally different, soilders face different missions and problems everday. they are brave, not afraid to die, and they try to defend there country. i think erich remarque did a great job on getting the real story about war. every senior english class should read this book.",1,119

"really excellent rock recording.: i have seen todd snider live 5 times, and would recommend you see him if you get the chance. he is about as entertaining a live performer as they come. unlike his live performances, which are folk singer affairs (just him and an acoustic guitar), this is a rock and roll recording. and a really excellent one, at that. ""rocket fuel,"" ""i am too,"" i am two,"" the excellent psychedelic ""guaranteed,"" and ""godsend,"" are all fine pieces of rock and roll. the great, great song here, though, is ""can't complain,"" which is one of my all-time favorite songs by anyone, period. every time i hear that song i have to hit the back button on my cd player and immediately play it again. it's a song so good you have to hear it twice in a row. kudos also should go to will kimbrough, who lays down tasty rock guitar all over this cd. highly, highly recommended.",1,161
"not only is he hot, but he's got talent!: the title says it all...not only is bosson a total hottie, but he's got a great voice! i saw him on tour with britney and i must say that he brought down the house! i totally recommend getting his hit single ""we live.""",1,52
"ultravox mon amour!: like the other reviewers here, i too, counted three into one as one of the best anthologies by the pre-ure ultravox. that is, until this set came along. this generous anthology serves up all the key tracks - from the eno-produced ""the wild, the beautiful and the damned"" to ""my sex"" and ""hiroshima mon amour"", this version of ultravox was the missing link between roxy music and adam ant, punk and new wave, glam and art-rock. its influence on everything that came out of the u.k. in the eighties can't be measured. you certainly don't need all three island albums; this set is absolutely all you require and you should do so without guilt or remorse. recommended.",1,120
"fun, upbeat, and motivating: i've got a large library of exercise dvd's, some of them boring, others okay, and a few that are just plain fun. this one falls in the latter category...it makes you want to move, with simple instruction, but also dance moves that are more than the simple basics you sometimes get. she breaks it down, then speeds it up, then puts together 3 different moves, and you repeat it twice a few times, and then one of each for another few times until you really get it. it's a good length as well, about 40 minutes.highly recommend it.",1,102
a great game: diablo 2 is a great improvement on the original diablo. there is a great depth to the game that much improves on the original storyline of diablo. there are now four fully populated cities with at least six characters in each who you can trade with and get advice from. each of the cities has their own problem that you have to solve. you solve the problems by completing the quests given to you by the characters. there is an almost unlimited supply of weapons and armor you get. there are unique and magical items that you can only find once in the game. there is a slight improvement in graphics from the original diablo. there a five video clips in the game- one before each act and one at the end- which are pretty good but take up allot of hard drive space. a full install of the game will take a little over 1.5 gigs of hard drive.,1,163

"insight: jesse very calmly observes his target, while his target thinks he's getting the low-down on whom he perceives as a very stupid sheriff. jesse's persona is deceiving. he's a guiet man who watches other people's behavior. jesse's very quick as a trained post la cop turned sheriff in a sleepy town. his instincts are very good at picking out people who are going to do bad. jesse does have his internal demons and his emotional intensity for his ex-wife, neither one will let the other move-on. it's jesse's emotional drama with his ex-wife and drinking that are his vices. that part gets a little boring; but when you love someone, you just can't let go. jesse's too patient or to pathetic in the love department.",1,126
"concealing a terminal disease: i applaud and respect, ms.brookshire. i believe from reading her testimony, that she is a woman of god, and was highly favored during this ordeal. in this book, i learned what that phrase ""no weapon formed against me shall prosper.i can't believe her then mother-in-law, knew of her son's medical status, and did not warn this woman, this makes the mother, her son accomplice.no wonder why they both got what they deserved.this woman is a real ""trooper"". god bless you.",1,84
"shivering: i must admit that while i was read it i was sad,afraid and thrilled at the same time.the character of mike noonan was excellent and the plots and events as i turned the pages just kept getting better and better.the characters of sara tidwell and max devore were just horrifying.i finished the book around midnight and the image of sara standing with her son did not help me get sleep.it is a must read for anyone as it has everything...love,suspense,sadness and ofcourse horror.another stephen king book done and i am not yet done.",1,94
"this guy can sing!: long time coming is a stylistic change for jonny as he has moved away from the blues. instead he favors rock, pop, and soul on this album. his voice isn't as raspy as in his previous work, but his vocals are still excellent. the songwriting is very good and the album flows nicely. my only complaint is that long time coming doesn't showcase jonny's guitar skills. there are only a few solos on the album and his guitar tone isn't as dirty as it was on smokin', lie to me, or wander this world. overall, good album by jonny but i would reccomend getting lie to me and wander this world before this one. another artist to check out is howard lee edwards. i recently discovered him and i really like his music. he has a new album coming out soon and there are a couple of songs off it on his website www.howardleeedwards.com. check it out!",1,161
"to be used for browsing and eyebrow raising: what is this thing called war ? it is such a shocking, but also such a normal, such a human thing that it penetrates history and literature books alike. this book is not a description of parts of the war, such as "" touched with fire"" by eric bergerud ( about gualdalcanal and new guinea) nor a study about political motives leading to war. this book is more like an almanac, giving information about the war that is less known but in a dry, almost tongue in cheek way. it is an absolute must for every one who wants to read about ww ii.",1,112
another great suncast product: i have 2 of there deck boxes and two of there trash cans so when i was shopping for a storage cabinet i went right to suncast.got home tonight found the item waiting took it out of the box and within 10 minutes it was put together like every other suncast product i own this is must what i expected well made easy to put together and will last forever.it is not as tough as a deck box but then again its not going to be sat on once again well done !!!!!,1,97

a book that takes a real look at matters of faith: this book tackles some tough issues related to god and matters of faith. as i read it kept sounding like the book that i always wanted to write. it is obvious that his views are the result of serious introspection and engagement. it is a book for people who are not afraid to use their minds where religion and spirituality is concerned,1,73

good for quick touch up: i received the product promptly. i use it when my hair is wet or i wet the stick if my hair is dry. my sister has used this product for years and recommended it to me. it is a good product to use on the crown of your head when you need a quick touch up and don't have time to do a full root color. my colored hair is medium brown so i bought dark brown. my natural color is white.,1,87
"best one yet.: i read this book in three days and i loved every minute of it. i think some people don't like it, because the tone has changed from excitement of discovering the world of wizards; to dealing with some penent up emtions, which have finally over-flowed. the tone of the book is bitterness of the situation that harry is put in. it is a typical rebellious teen additude of feeling left out because now more than ever he feels that he can contribute to the ""cause"" as an equal. unfortunatly harry is still treated like a kid which only angers him futher. for those that have watched star wars, this is the empire stikes back of the series. to me dylan thomas the poet has said it best for the theme of this book and that is ""do not go gentle into that good night"", ""rage, rage against the dying of the light.""",1,155

"good, but also repetitive: the mccade books are very good, among my all-time faves, but they're getting a bit repetitive. at least this time around there aren't any assasins, but in alien bounty mccade manages to wind up in chains not once but twice, and once again manages to get rescued by his buds, rico, eversoheavily armed, and phil, once a slave himself. in the next novel, mccade's bounty, our galactic space hero's daughter is enslaved by the space pirates. i swear, i would be suprised if in mccade's world anyone lower in status than lakorian royalty was not a slave at some point, considering the stats. also, the part in alien bounty about mustapha pong is a bit short. other than those two points, though, mccade on the run excels. it weaves an intricate, complex universe in its diverse worlds, some of which entirely artificial. dont expect any of that ""oh, it's a lava world"" nonsense.this book deserves 4.5 stars, but hey, i'm a pessimist.",1,166
"nemesis just like jason: had the nemesis worn a hockey mask they could've just referred to him as jason. he is just like jason from friday the 13th because he's super-strong and very powerful and no matter how many times you drop him he just won't die and keeps coming back (til the end)....this game serves as a very worthy installment in terms of sounds, graphics, and gameplay. this one pretty much had it all but they should do without the giant spiders next time.",1,85

"odd concept...great show.: i heard ""who will love me as i am?"" on a talk show and i immediately fell in love with the combination of these two women's voices. unfortunately, some of the songs are a little odd, but when it comes to ""broadway"" songs, along with ""who will love me..."", ""i will never leave you"" is powerful and beautiful. these two women better have another theatre vehicle soon! it would be such a waste if they don't work on another show together. the other cd's which they've released are on my list for my birthday. i know that i won't be disappointed. too bad the show wasn't given the chance that it deserved.",1,115

"best travel mug i've owned: i've had quite a few travel mug. so far, this is the best that i've ever had. first of all, it keeps the coffee hot for quite a while. i would say, it stays warm enough to be pleasant around 5 hours. also, how hot it stays depends on how often you open it. the second reason i love this mug is it is super simple to clean. there is nowhere for the coffee to get trapped and fester. it's also really simple to put together. lastly, it's really easy to tell if it's open or not. i love this thing.",1,106
"a true jazz classic: this is one of my all time favorite albums, just beautiful. metheny at his absolute best.",1,20

great wide-angle: i am very pleased with this lens. images are sharp all the way to the corners. i can't see any chromatic aberration. recommended.,1,25
"quirky, off-beat material that any denver fan will love: i have listented to this album hundreds of times. my father used to take the tape along when we went fishing in wisconsin and we would listen to it over and over together. the material is a real departure from what john denver usually records. there is a john prine song in there, a christmans song, a song about the canadian rockies, and it all fits together to form a relaxing, interesting record. i highly recommend farwell andromeda to any john dever fan. it's different, but i bet you'll be playing it over and over just as i have.mike grabowski",1,109
"awsome!!!: this is ""the lord of all trilogys!"" the lord of the rings-the motion picture trilogy is the boxed-set that you will want to have in your home. i realy like the fellowship of the ring and the return of the king, but i don't like the two towers quite as much. overall, this trilogy rocks and it is worth anything you pay. buy it!!",1,65
"great little piece of equipment......: i've had a larger bread machine for years and didn't use it much because of the time and hassle involved. i stumbled onto the ""just for dinner"" bread machine by west bend on the internet, ordered it, and it fits me perfectly. i'm a 77 year old guy living in an apartment and i like it's small size too. it makes a good looking, good tasting loaf that's plenty for two meals for me so it would be a great plenty for a meal, or more, for two people. i think this machine is a winner !!",1,102

"a well-organized introduction to policy studies: weimer's ""policy analysis -3rd edition"" provides a well-organized, widely-covered, and easily-understandable introduction to policy analysis. although we have to seek for other materials for an in-depth analysis of some topics, the book helps us start with public policy, policy analysis, and even economic policies. this is especially good for undergraduate level, since this provides how to study, investigate, and write policy paper.",1,68
"cholest-off results: i just reordered this product as i got my results after being on it for two months, my previous count was 253 and now is 232 and this is with minor change to my diet and exercise . i intend to continue on the product and increase my activity and hope for a better level in four months.",1,60
great for the pregnant lady: i wear a size xs pea in the pod/ motherhood maternity clothes. i ordered this in a small and it was great for a pregnancy costume. no matter how big your belly is just order the size you would normally be. the skirt portion will just be up high like a maternity shirt. i wore black pants underneath. the costume was the best! only complaint is that the plastic material was smelly & hot if you were not out in the cool air. i aired the costume out and it was great!,1,97
"good quality, fast delivery.: i have been very pleased with quality of these snowshoes and have had no problems with them after multiple hikes. the tote bag is much larger than i've seen with other package deals and the price was better than the comparable items i looked at. would definitely recommend.",1,52

"i would watch james nesbitt in a twilight film: i love this guy, he made a fan of me with ""jekyll"", a wonderful retelling, and solidified his status with ""five minutes of heaven"". he does great work in this piece, it may have been a bit too grim, itv hasn't renewed it for a second season. too bad, back to the search engines, but i did watch the six episodes back to back, so i recommend it heartily.",1,78
"love it, love it, love it!: just a reprinting in one volume of all the recipe pages from that year's sunset magazines, but they are great recipes and well indexed.",1,30
"if you have a teen, get this book now!: i have been through teen hell over the past two years, and i was extremely frustrated that none of the social workers, psychiatrists, psychologists, teachers, or other parents could tell me what to do to attempt to get through this. they were great at telling me why it was happening, though. michael bradley not only tells you why it is happening, but tells you very clearly what to do. get the book, and make your spouse read it, too.",1,88
"professional caliber bread in your kitchen: worth every bit of the effort. most bakers scale down or simplify their recipes, it appears silverton did neither. this is bread baking ecstasy!! i quartered the recipe minimizing wasted flour and it worked fine, and i refrigerate it every so often for a week at a time. this is professional caliber bread in my kitchen, and that's a dream come true. thanks to nancy for sharing.",1,73
"amazing.............: ok for all of you r&b love song people ( i am one if them)i know u all of u look for the words. all the slow ""love songs"" are written by the man himself, there are also some uptempos ongs he had some help on. one thing youll hear on this cd is the meaningful words, but the chords, vocals, instruments, evrything. it will capture your mind, when u hear brians vocals on ""6,8,12"" u know that it cant get any better, then you hear the breakdown on ""shall we begin"" smooth....as silk. but dont leave out the 5 uptempo songs where it can get no better, in my opion way better than ""you should be mine"". overall this album is much better than his ""anytime"" album which had a bit more hip-hop/pop sound to it. the only reson it does get only 4 stars is becuse i dont know what mr. mcknight will deliver next...can it get better? im just not sure - ray roa",1,168
"excellent piece of work: this album is a must for any christain person who is into rock/pop. you could say, that lampa has a voice talent similar to a brintey spears, willa ford, only on a christain level. her voice brings out the holy spirit in you. my two favorite songs are ""day of freedom"" and ""always be my home"" i am catholic and this would be a excellent to listen in front of our lord himself. the song will move you inw ays you may not noticed before in your faith. ""days of freedom"" has an middle eastern type of flavor to it. my listening to her music, you can tell she is on fire for our lord!",1,119

"too cute for words: this fabulous wall calendar features the work of jeanne carley, whose photographic artistry and originality is unmatched. how she gets those fuzzies to pose like that i'll never know! sure, there are other ferret calendars out there, but they simply can't hold a candle to this one. the poses . . . the expressions . . . everything about these photos will melt your heart. just look at that little guy playing the drums. no wonder these calendars sell out so quickly!!",1,86
super movie: this movie is a must see for teachers. it really helps one to see the humor and the obstacles teachers face. sandy dennis is wonderful as the naive new teacher and all that she goes through during her first year. i recommend highly.,1,45
"fun for everyone: this is the type of movie that's good for kids, but still entertaining for adults.if you're in you're late 20's like me and remember movies like flight of the navigator, then you'll really like this.although flight of the navigator will seem dated now, the last mimzy gave me the same feeling after seeing it, but with excellent special effects.overall, a little bittersweet but very engaging. a- from me.",1,71
"i love this blender!: after reading some of the reviews on the magic bullet blender and the problems that people were having with it, i decided to go with the tribest blender and i am glad i did. this is a phenomenal blender. it is compact, travels well and works perfectly. i love it for my pre-workout shake and also for my post workout shakes. it is fast and efficient and cleans up quickly. great quality product that is redefining the blender world for people who are on the go and busy.",1,92
great great movie!: very well written movie. great cast. great directors and writers. all that combined equals this very creative movie. what more can be said?,1,26
"aspiring wiccans will love this book: this book is extremely helpful for those interested in wicca and the craft. it gives you tips on how to tell your parents of your interest and how to answer the questions they'll have. it also gets you started on your book of shadows. telesco gives you a few sample spells and rituals to get you started and to put in your book. she also includes information about your star sign, such as ""aromas that accent the positive"", ""love, family and friendship"", ""power colors"", ""body tips"", ""clothes and jewelry"" and ""the future"". she also includes a chapter on ""bedroom feng shui"". there's also information on how to create your own spells. there are spells for relieving anger, calming your nerves before a class presentation, and many other helpful spells. i, personally, loved this book, and am planning on reading patricia telesco's ""your book of shadows"" next.",1,152

"i love this receiver: for the money, this is a top product. i don't have any hi-def, but i do have an extra zone in my house and this was the best for the money. i love the sound - it's a lot softer than my old sony. i think the dialogue in 5-channel is clearer.",1,56
"a fresh sound to a point. . .: with some of the same tone and feeling as nik bärtsch's ronin modal improvisations, this album of the postmodern avant-garde trio the bad plus demonstrates why they were selected for the recent album of disney covers, everybody wants to be a cat. their deconstruction of familiar tunes and their own compositions (three by bassist anderson, two by drummer king, and one by pianist iverson) are energetic and often noisy. each musician is a percussionist, each a melody maker. the scratchy, nervous music may be jarring to many, but others may appreciate the cleverness, humor, and audacity. the lyricism between the discord, as with track 5, giant, arises as a fresh breeze. the well-matched team of musicians create a fresh, bright and challenging sound. the problem is that repeated listening tarnishes that brilliance. the musical approach soon seems to be only a gimmick.",1,150
"lots of action: great book if you like action stories. complex, well-developed characters. intriguing plot. four sets of villains, sometimes hard to keep track of who's who, especially everybody is not what the seem. long discourses on bible history sometimes interrupts action at inappropriate times. cotton malone is a wonderfully developed character and i will read additional steven berry books with this character.",1,63
"all you can get: these gems reflect the high points in kd lang's career. three truly excellent albums, they display lang's songwriting and vocal skills. not that the rest of her discography doesn't, but ""absolute torch and twang"", ""ingenue"" and ""all you can eat"" will surely attract a less diversified audience, someone who will look for the artist's representative works. pay extra attention to ""trail of broken hearts"", ""constant craving"" and ""infinite and unforeseen"", amongst others. ideal for those ""who are yet to be converted"".",1,85
"to new to know, but still sounds promising: lets consider what is being said about this game: 80+hours of play. twice the levels, quests, and side quests(or more) of the first one. 5 characters, not 3. animation that goes beyond the wonderful details and quality of the first. the ability to create new and powerful items and weapons, and use parts from the ones you find, or to buy parts.play magazine (hey, i like to site my sources) has done a wonderful job covering it past issues, giving it a b+ on review (pretty high for them), and the reviews from other game magazines (gamers, ign, opm) sound favorable too. yeah, its going to be like the first one... its a sequel, set in the same place. however, if you liked the first, and you know the first, dont worry... the second sounds like it is as good, if not better. (4 stars because the first one was good, and this one isnt released yet.)",1,165
great book for historic perspective on central highlands: a great book for a recent but historic perspective on the vietnamese central highlands and her people.,1,25

"it good nice but ?: i got the sony cyber shot when i was in uae, price is so good most of the thing about this sony is good , but the only problem i am facing is when downloding the photo to pc i could not do it. i am using window me. and install the softer for the cyber but up to now nothing i can see the imges on the print mode but the editing mode , pls. help to do that. thank you",1,87
"you're so flamboyant: i could listen to this song over and over again. it has the techno pop feel that all pet shop boys have. i have never come across a psb song that i didn't like. i first learned of ""flamboyant"" when it was featured on the popart cd. it's a great song.",1,54
"a royal success!: who wouldn't want to work with wes anderson? after his first two movies (rushmore, bottle rockets) won great praise from critics and viewers alike this was one of the most anticipated flicks of last year. take a heaping of gene hackmans dry delivery and sprinkle in a hip cast of the best of young hollywood has to offer then cover it all with andersons painterly scenes. one of the best things about anderson his his use of music and though tenenbaums is a little heavy in the soundtrack department he still uses tunes as well as anybody in hollywood. for those who are surprised by this brand of film making try out some hal ashby (harold and maude).",1,121
"good book for developers, analysts, architects and managers: author has given good thaught about presenting the jini technology to not only developers but also for the analysts, architects and managers of distributed application development.author has given insight on the jini technology and its role in distributed environment by comparing with the currently available technologies such as corba, rmi and dcom+",1,60

"awesome sneaker: wow, great fit, confort, easy to get on and off. gum rubber shoe really grips the court, even on really dirty floors. fantastic sneaker for racquetball or wood court surfaces.",1,32
"great all around: good quality dvd and excellent movie. i wasn't sure what to expect from the uncut version (i love the american releaseof ""the professional""), but i think the added material does enhance the movie. it's rather embarrassing to think that the rest of world got ""leon"" and we got the ""babied"" version. there's nothing objectionable here.",1,58
"wonder woman...finally!: being the designer of the dvd packaging, i had to watch the entire first season before creating the package....and keep in mind i had not seen these episodes since the 70s when i was a kid.watching them now, of course they may be dated in regards to special effects, but what comes through...still...is how charming and wonderful lynda carter is in the title role. i can't help but smile watching her magnetism on screen. has an actress ever fit a iconic role more than ms. carter? i don't think so. this alone is worth the price of the dvd boxed set...but seeing the fun episodes and how entertaining they really are, makes it a keeper. you can have your special effects laden ""super hero"" movies.....give me the sweetness and strength of ms. carter's diana prince/wonder woman any day.",1,140
"the best book i've seen on the subject.: this book clearly explains the operation of caches and mp systems in a way i've never seen before. the books used in my computer architecture class always left me with a somewhat vague feeling on how things worked, plus they only barely mentioned the software issues. similarly, my os class never really got into mp subjects like memory ordering and the effect of caches on the os. but this book brought everything into focus with clear explanations and good examples.the best way to describe this book is that it's part computer architecture book and part operating systems book. the operation of the hardware is presented in good detail, without going as far as worrying about gates and transistors. the software issues are also described in detail along with various solutions and trade-offs between them.i highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to understand the operation of caches and smp systems from both the hardware and software point of view.",1,168
"this is how country should sound.....: i don't know how many of you that are reading this own the star room boys' first album....but if you don't.....buy it! then, buy this one too. dave marr is probably one of, if not the best songwriters in country music today. i don't really listen to what passes for country radio, and i was lucky (blessed even?) to find out about the star room boys back in the glory days of napster. i ended up downloading every song off of ""why do lonely men and women..."", and subsequently bought the cd....hey, what do you know? ... anyhoo, i highly recommend both star room boys cds. you will not be disappointed.",1,117
"the most subtle and sophisticated yet: i read a reader who thought these books weren't for older people. don't be fooled by the size. the concept is terrific and if you read carefully, you can see that something very sophisticated and fascinating is being woven slowly like a web. i will charge out to get the next one. so should you.",1,61
excellent: i desperately needed a very good hands-free headset. i studied for a few days what was available and diligently read through the reviews and finally decided on kx-tca60. could not be happier!!! thanks to all the reviews that led me to purchase it. i highly recommend it.,1,48
"probably the most exiting album of the year!: this album makes me happy everytime i hear it( almost everyday), it is so much better than live through this, because it has more passion in its songs, and it's full of happiness. courtney was really inspirated when she wrote the album lyrics, they're so cool and the songs are delicious to listen to. i love it and recomend it to everyone who still have a doubt on buying this, it's gratious and has also the hard guitars that are on the live through this as well. i mostly enjoy the songs ""awful"", ""calebrity skin"" and ""heaven tonight"". a must hear!!",1,109
"we've watched this again and again. it's delightful!!: my husband and i both love this movie and have watched it many times. the scenery is gorgeous and the music is just wonderful. i taped it, but would like to have a 'real' copy very much. don't listen to the critics!!",1,50
"brain lock: very good practical advice for anyone who wants to get insight into curbing obsessive thinking.i would recommend this to anyone as a valuable self-help book whether you have ocd or not .the value is that it helps you identify and deal with thought patterns that are counter to your mental well being.the message of the book is the development of mindfulness but it is very practical and i have taken the authors advice to my benefit.it does go on a bit too much about the world of ocd sufferers which i got a bit tired of, but other people probably wouldn't . this is an immensely practical and commonsense approach to helping people with ocd and their families .i highly recommend this book.",1,125
"perfect target: also great product, shipping, price and service. thanks for giving all american's the opportunity to take a shot at him!",1,22
farmer fan: this quilting book was exceptional. it was very detailed and easy to understand. i was impressed with the variety of farm quilts. they showed great detail. i liked the variety of colors that were used. my daughter loves the denim and bow tie quilt. she plans on decorating her daughters room in some type of country theme and this is a great bedspread for a girl. the pockets add alot of character. the techniques of this book were well explained for the beginner to the more advanced quilter. this book will be a great book for your quilting collection.,1,101

"gameboy advance is the best handheld game so far: gameboy advance is great, it is definitly worth it. although this is in indigo (mine is too, i bought it when it 1st came out and that was the last color left) its the most lively color. and about the poorly lit screen everyone so much hates, there r things 2 help, like worm light, gameshield light, and my personaly favorite the backlit light. and if u dont like those there r other alternatives, like gamegear (which is outdated yet effective) even though it is huge if the lighting is that bad for u get gg.",1,105

a great book...: deb gets a taste at temptation from a man who knows what he wants. this book had me hooked. i couldn't put it down until i had to force my self to sleep. this is a great book to read.,1,43
just started taking it: i just started taking this yesterday. i read the review about the proper way to take it (with food and a ton of water) and am sticking to that and haven't had any negative side effects mentioned in the other reviews. i took it once in the morning and once at night and again this morning. the first 2 pills made me feel really warm almost immediately. i was expecting this a little but it was more than i was expecting. i feel ok though after taking the one this morning. i'm hopeful that it'll help rev my metabolism and help me break this plateau for additional weight loss but it's too early to tell yet.,1,120
can not stop listening to this cd: this whole cd is great. the songs are addicting. your body just starts to dance with the beats. even when your are not listening to it the songs are stuck in your head. buy this now!,1,43
"good indoor antenna: i used this antenna to get ota braodcasts in my basement. although the product manual says that it will not work in basements, it worked just fine. i am about 20-30 miles from the towers.terk hdtva is the amplified version of hdtvi. without the amplification, i received a snowy picture, but a crisp one with amplification. only irritant is that you have to position the antenna and dipoles every time you change channels...",1,76
"serious noise cancelling: my office mate and i actually both bought a pair at the same time - and now we joke that people have to email us before they come in because we can't hear them. the sound is quite loud, and the sized rubber earbuds and that actually go in your ear make them seriously noise cancelling. i would definitely not recommend these for outdoor running/walking/biking because they allow so little outside noise in. however, for the gym, the office, the library, etc, they are great. the sound quality is not concert quality but extremely good for mid-range headphones. great buy for the price, just be warned that you will hear nothing from the outside world!",1,118
"the best import album you'll ever buy...: i bought this album in the uk, and it really is brilliant. its everyhing you ever wanted from the uk club scene rolled into 2 cd's. its, the culmination of popular songs from the clubs of ibiza to the uk charts. any americans into the club music of the uk should definately buy this cd... its not the best kiss album the radio station has ever released but it sure does contend with the other compilation albums of this year.",1,87
perfect!: i had been looking for the perfect souffle dish and didn't want to spend a ton of money.this is perfect! it works just as described and the color is wonderful!arrived on time and in perfect condition.,1,37
"a classic: many people think this album was the last of nofx's ability to label themselves as punk rock and retain a sense of dignity. i happen to disagree with these people. anyhoo, this album is a real classic. it's when nofx really got there s..tuff together. fat mikes story telling seems much more fine tuned in punk in drublic than in more recent things. contains tons of energy and clever lyrics. anyways, to summurize:this is one of the best punk albums ever and if you don't like this...you probably don't like punk. but don't feel bad....punk doesn't like you either.",1,101
"a must see series!!!: by far one of the best series i have ever seen. i am not going to write a long review just read all the others here. i am only on episode two and already hooked, can't hardly wait to see the next disk. this is a must see, especially in blu-ray format.",1,56
"a more morose sheila e.: after the phenomenal success of sheila e.'s debut album, ""the glamourous life"", she followed the next year (1985) with the moderately successful, ""romance 1600"". ""sister fate"", her obvious ode to prince, was the first release from this sophomore effort, and a very mundane number that lacked the ummf that the single ""glamourous life"" exuded . next was ""love bizarre"" (her 12 minute plus duet with prince)which actually saved the album from complete ennui and possibly diminished record sales. ""dear michealangelo"", ""yellow"" and the title track itself are listenable, but really don't measure up to the fire of the songs on ""the glamourous life"".",1,108
"spectacular coverage of a spectacular music label: one of the best things about lps, as opposed to cds, was the ability to flip the sleeves in stores during browsing. i started listening to jazz in the early 1980's, and was rapidly transfixed by the beauty and originality of the artwork on releases from the ecm jazz label, out of germany. since 1970, ecm has released nearly 700 albums of wonderful music, much of which defies categorization. what remains is their clearly identifiable (but often imitated - such as by windham hill) cover graphic style, making their releases art collector items as well as music. this book describes the history of the ecm sleeve art, as well as provides color pictures of essentially all of their releases up to the publication date of the book. this book is a wonderful gift to music, as well as art, lovers!",1,147
"gift that keeps on giving: i first bought this book for a class in 1987. i have since bought it again and again somewhere around 12 times. the ""mistake"" i make is that i lend it to a friend and they fall in love with it and with milosz too and then, i just let them keep it and i buy it again because i understand. to say that this book transformed the way i look at poetry and art as a whole is an understatement. it should be a core component of any discussion of 20th century aesthetics. it's a masterpiece.",1,102
"pretty good!: pretty much the average jansport! i still recommend getting a dakine, just because it lasts longer, but this is pretty good too.",1,24
red shoes....warning!: these shoes are beautiful and comfortable. i usually wear a 9 1/2 so that's what i ordered and they fit perfectly. keep in mind....if you buy the red ones they transfer color like crazy! they make your socks red and then if you put on a different pair of shoes the color will come off those socks and stain the insides of the other shoes. they even come with a warning inside the box that says the color will transfer easily. i wouldn't buy the red again but they are gorgeous.,1,93
good buy!: cant even tell it's fake! very good quality for a very good price! this will be my replacement whenever we travel to avoid losing my real ones. thanks!,1,30
"excelent!!!: this is an great cuality of towels, it really worth the money. very soft material mi baby love it! i have about 13 diferents kinds and i just use this two kinds, because it keeps the baby warm, plus they do a great job. some of the others brands are terrible they get all wet a firt and no even dry the baby as they should. i recommend it!",1,70
works well: i am pleased with its performance. getting radio reception in my area has always been frustrating. so i purchased this to help and it does.,1,27
"their best yet: i know people always say that a new album is the band's ""best yet"", just because it is new. however, i say this after much thought. the band mxpx has left behind some of the pure punk heard on ""pokinatcha"" or ""teenage politics"" and went more the way of the buffalo. instead of the fuzzy guitar riffs, and hyperactive drums, we have polished pop-punk and hyperactive drums. a great tradeoff.most of the songs on this album have the catchiness of ""i'm okay, you're okay"" or ""the downfall of western civilization"". the best cuts on this album are ""responsibility"" and ""the next best thing"".if you are a fan of mxpx, or even of blink 182, gob, less than jake, or other similar bands, pick up this album: you won't regret it.pxpx!",1,133

"nice small glider: this rocker was purchased for my mom and she loves it. it is a nice rocker that isn't noisy and provides a smooth rocking back and forward. cushions are nice neutral color. only complaint is that the seat cushion is thin and hasn't held its shape. it has been used everyday for the last month by my mom who is only 124 pounds, and the cushion has already lost its loft. otherwise it was a wise purchase.",1,80
"sony kv-32hs420: for the purpose i got this it does a great job. we use it to watch dvd's, we have it hooked through the s-video connection and it looks great. eventually we plan to upgrade to the hdmi connection and i'm sure it'll look much better. there's enough inputs in this tv to fill anyones needs.we tried hooking up our kids video games to it but it actually looked worst than our 10 year old quasar, it sort of looked too pixelated?! so we kept our games connected to the ""old box."" maybe i just need to read the manual and change some settings?sony makes great products, but i really hate their customer service with a passion. i purposely stayed away from buying their products for over 13 years. if i could find anything comparable i would always go with the competition. with this tv i couldn't so i broke down and finally bought another sony.another thing, it's really heavy, i believe it weighs over 150 lbs. i was able to move it but i'm not a small guy.....",1,180

"eye opening narrative of the iraqi experience: this is third book i read on the iraq war the the subsequent occupation (corba ii and fiasco), found that ""imperial life.."" is the most successful in providing a clear insight as to way things have not gone well. essentially, the bush adminstration treated the occupation and subsequent reconstruction of iraq as went another political patronage exercise without regard to expertise and without a plan let alone a good one.everyone should read this book, because in many ways in provides a clear picture as to why we have failed thus far.",1,98

"excellent as always, though oriented toward die-hard fans: like the first 3 collections, this one has a great variety of episodes, and its fair share of a+ ones which are as fine as anything that has ever been shown on tv. unlike the first 3 collections, this one has several rarely seen and/or double length episodes, and is even more of an acquired taste. die-hard fans and collectors will want to own this set. those exploring tz might try one of the other 3 collections first. if you like, read my reviews of those as well.",1,96
"fantastic voyage: i first heard the waybacks driving to the airport. told my wife, ""hey this is really good stuff!"" i'm pretty critical of what i listen to. i listen a lot, but not everything catches my ear. first heard them do i wanna be like you and loved every minute. then we saw the guys in person in rutherfordton, nc. what at great night in a saloon! there is chemistry which is hard to find in many groups these days. there is creativity which crosses many lines of music including jazz, bluegrass, rock, etc. the musicianship is 5 star and one only has to listen to bright place and last date to discover the sensual, sexual, creative side of these guys. i hope they stay together and continue to produce this kind of stuff forever. if you don't like what you hear, move south and thaw out.",1,148
"i love this album: i listen to this almost every day at work. the humor is subtle enough i can listen to it at work and it's entertaining. this album takes you back to mayberry, at least for a little while.",1,41
"wonderful alternative to buying the complete seasons: just enough to reminiscencemy son, 7yrs old, actually pointed this out to me awhile ago, and i'm glad he did. being a child of the 80's this was one of my go to after-school shows...always loved looking for orko during the episode. anyway, if your planning on buying the completed seasons don't get this. the episodes on this ""best of"" will be in those box sets. however, if you want a few good hours, 2 discs, to remember the days of he-man then this is more than enough to quench that thirst for a trip down memory lane.an excellent buy and a well produced product with hard plastic sleeves. you will get a chance to see most of your favorite allies and foes with this sampling. this is a wonderful alternative to buying the complete seasons...perfect!",1,143
"kept my attention!: i started reading this book while walking on the treadmill.. i normally hate doing cardio because i get so bored and cant seem to get in the grove. i enjoyed this book so much that i looked forward to doing cardio, just so i could simply read. it kept my attention, and kept me wanting more.. its very different from nicholas sparks other books in that it does have mystery and intense parts!",1,76
"very romantic: you can listen to the entire album without skiping to the next track.a very nice mix of country, folk and popular music.must have album for dinner parties!!!one of the greatest voices i have ever heard.",1,37
"perfect blend of written music: an earthly, romantically written novel on the passions of music and destiny. this uniquely compelling story touches on subjects that some, these days, tend to forget. anyone who loves a good story would regret not reading this. the power of music moves us all, and it moves this book as well.",1,56
"just takes some getting used to......: i am strictly a beginner with no previous knowledge of any of the forms of japanese, so this book was confusing at first. once i got the hang of the book's method of teaching, the chapters went by a little smoother.i get the feeling of a stern, business-like presentation of the material, and in fact, the author does mention that his original goal was to teach ibm employees...",1,74
"guilty pleasure: this is sort of like the bubble gum music of new age. but who cares? its simple direct melodies, bouncy rhythms and colorful sound just get you hooked. it gets lots of play time in my cd collection.",1,40

"my eyes are open now: this book was written with much careful thought and planning. it shows that even a man of god can go through trials and tribulations and come out as pure gold. i wish that everyone would read this book so that we can have power from god to forgive. roman 12:21 says ""be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."" i'm glad that i read the book. it showed me that no matter what i go through, i should forgive. it helped me to learn that the person you love the most can hurt you, but to forgive them and move on. god has ordered john's steps with his word. he will be blessed abundantly.",1,121
wonderful prose & poignant characters: bravo! to elizabeth strout. a touching and enjoyable book. the truth often really is stranger than fiction. amy & isabelle celebrates the beauty and nobility of the everyday life of ordinary people.,1,37

fun!: my 5 year old has these in white and loves them. we like that they are a little bit big - it makes it easier for him to put them on. its fun for roll playing.,1,37
"great for everyday use!: i really liked the design of this set. it has a fun and playful design which is great for everyday use. i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because one of the sets, even though the same design was less bright then the rest. the greens and blues just weren't as brightly colored. more like they had some fading. must be something that happened at the factory because from what i know, the colors will never fade. these were a great price too!",1,88
"greatest: nothing to say except if you havent seen you must...this is a cult classic and you will then understand ""multipass""",1,21
"great romance with real family values: there are many reasons to like this book, but my favorite aspect is that it shows a non-traditional family full of love and respect. three orphaned boys find a little girl in a trash pile and band together to raise her as their sister. the romance element of the book is good, as well as the part where mary rose finds her biological father, but the relationships of mary rose and her four unconventional brothers are what make this book a must read.",1,89
"fun and games!: besides great richard scarry stories, there is even a game inside! it is a very fun christmas time story book.",1,23
"a must for new spidey fans (and veteran fans too): after about a ten year absence from the world of the web-slinger, i picked this up in 2001...oh, my god! you never will want it to end. it's a ""modernization and revamp"" of peter parker's genesis as the amazing spider-man. it is a little bit different from the original stan lee stories (and the movie), but it's very well done. i highly recomend you snag all three volumes of this and v.1 & 2 of the essential spider-man, if you're new to the world of spider-man. but this is a great place to start.",1,104
"forgotten eastwood film that also stars george kennedy: simple plot but a nice change of pace considering his path of westerns and soon to be string of dirty harry cop films, eastwood is every bit his own man in this mountain climbing adventure. the film is based on a novel by trevanian, and surrounds the story of a man sent with 3 other climbers. he is blackmailed to execute one of them while climbing with them in the swiss alps. stormy weather, icy conditions and that brutal devil called gravity also prove not to be jonathan hemlock's friend. eastwood plays the part of hemlock and does so quite convincingly, but not only that this is a gem in which it was also directed by eastwood himself! the drama that unfolds on the climb in the alps is nothing short of spectacular, and this is definitely a must see for eastwood fans of a younger generation of his films that might have missed it the first time.",1,166
"a very enjoyable book: this was a very enjoyable book because the characters and plot were so entertaining. two things detracted from it being a great book. first, the sexual ennuendos were poorly written. instead of arousing interest, i was thinking, ""how lame, enough already."" secondly, the plot was very busy, which necessitated the author quickly wrapping up all the loose ends at the end of the book. however, these two problems were relatively minor, and i could recommend this book heartily.",1,82
a great book of of poems: i loved the poems because they were wonderfly put together. my favorite chapter was:three queer tales. wonderful for all ages. one of my two favorite books of poems! you might need a good vocabulary to read it!!! it really gave me dreams!,1,48
great educational software: my 4 year old daughter loves this software and i feel good knowing that she's getting a jump start on science.there are simple video-game style games to play and lots of places to explore.i recommend to to anyone!,1,41
my favorite: this is my absolute favorite perfume these days. for years i wore clinique happy and loved it and still do but there is something in falling in love that i love even more. i do agree w/ another reviewer about how the smell doesn't last all day but for me it is a small price to pay for the scent that it gives.,1,65
"perfect angel is devilishly good: it's hard to believe that the most well known track on this album is the weakest. that notwithstanding this album is as near perfection as one could imagine or hope for. i bought a vinyl copy some 30 years ago and it still enthralls and moves me. the production, lyrical content and execution is a shining beacon in the wastelands of modern day r+b. like all perfect angels you are a comet amongst the stars minnie, still dazzling us with your brightness years after you passed by and long after other stars have faded",1,99
"couldn't put it down.....: this book was a very enjoyable read. sometimes you need a good naughty book to curl up and read. this does not disappoint. i enjoyed every word. some of the exclamation points were unnecessary, but it was a wonderful read. very sexy, full of suspense, and shocking.",1,51

"excellent adaptation of book: this dvd is an excellent adaptation of sayers' book! practically every twist, turn, and detail of the book is skillfully incorporated. often characters are speaking sayers' exact lines. the views of the fine old church add what a book cannot give. the actual sound of the bells also, though not very musical, add a valuable dimension.",1,60
"it's ergonomic, has a cord, and it works.: other than the elongated delete key (on the right) being under the home key (which used to be where the insert key was), this keyboard has a nice feel to it. if the cord is not an issue, and you have the space for it (it's bigger than the standard keyboard), then it's worth it. media and program keys are a bit much, but do add flexability.",1,75
"the best collection from the best of los boricuas: art, poetry, short stories, drawings. stories of religion, from catholic, to santeria. from growing up in hungry in the streets of spanish harlem, to growing up in the rural areas of la isla. from being a street hood, to being a chico and the man tv star. boricuas, is destined to be a classic. in this collection you get only the best, from the best puerto rican writers and poets. piri thomas, esmeralda santiago, judith cofer, nicholasa mohr, just to name a few of these talented writters. what i love the most about this book is that it will introduce many puerto ricans as well as the rest of the world to the many talented boricua authors there are. this book will fill you with pride and joy, if you are ever thinking of that perfect gift for that young adult boricua in your life, this is it.",1,157
"way better than you'd think: i first heard this at the dentist! i put on the headphones and settled in for drilling. at the first note, i was hooked! song after song was fantastic! i went out and bought it immediately. all the tunes are extremely funky and soulful. i don't know why this wasn't a bigger hit, it's really a terrific cd. every song is catchy and your head will be bobbing and your feet will be tapping. buy it.",1,81

"the pampered chef story: the book, the pampered chef, one of america's most beloved companies was very informative and engaging. it brought the reader through the stages of development of the company and gave the reader an inside look at the day to day development and experiences of the author. anyone reading this book will come away with a greater understanding of the great amount of perseverance it takes to build a multi-million dollar enterprise. the book details the step by step sucesses and near misses of the author as she followed her dream to fruition through hard work and careful risks.",1,102
"the original!: i would have given this 5 stars, but settled for 4 because i was expecting the re-release version with the new footage. its the original theatrical release. don't get me wrong, i love the original, but i was hoping at least for both versions of the film, like the dvd release had. i actually stopped it it when i realized it was the original and threw the dvd in!",1,71
"thank you, david.: in june, i attended a david sedaris reading, part of his latest book tour. at the end, he held up francine prose's ""blue angel"" and said it was the funniest book he's read in a long time. so, knowing his work, i went into this novel expecting laugh out loud hilariousness. this novel is so much more though. prose writes with such a clever hand that you don't often laugh out loud, but chuckle inside at her deft use of language and humor and wordplay. i loved the characters, especially swenson, his wife sherrie, and of course, the angela, the blue angel herself. if you've ever taken a college creative writing class, you'll appreciate the numerous scenes where student stories are workshopped. francine prose captures college life and student attitudes perfectly. this novel made me want to read other prose books.",1,144
"fits well and does the job.: this cover is sold especially for the bistro styled grill. it fits well, does not blow off and appears to be well made and sturdy. the uv rays here in florida are quite destructive and thus far there is no visible wear or discoloration. we are happy with this product.",1,56
"best i've tried so far.....: have long, fine hair...& am now using this with my hot rollers...the redken product made my hair positively crunchy..(tossed it out!).. this bottle is pretty small for someone with long hair, but gotta have something. it keeps the curls pretty well and adds some shine. will keep using till i find something better....",1,58
nice earrings: i am very pleased with these earrings. i get many compliments when i wear them. the best thing is that you can use them for a casual or formal look.,1,32
"connor loves it!: i'm so happy that i bought this for my new little man, connor thomas. he loves it. at first i was only going to buy one but i got such a good deal, that i got three (blue, white and green.) and what a good decision that was! connor loves his blankets! we have to have one with us at all times. they're light weight, perfect for crib bedding, beautiful, and sooo soft!!! wow! i wish this brand sold them in larger sizes for my bed. i'm very please with my purchase. if you buy one you won't regret. worth every cent.",1,105
"great carseat: i wasnt ready to put my 3yr old in a booster seat, but he was almost to outgrow the 40lb weight limit on his other carseat. the regent is perfect for him! it was easy to install, and fits in our minivan great! and this seat will fit him for years to come. i'd definitely recommend this seat to a friend.",1,63
"the original santa clause: this was undoubtedly the inspiration for the tim allen films. it is one of the best christmas stories i know of. it is no wonder that this particular episode was set apart and put out as a special vhs tape. i doubt anyone will read this that isn't already familiar with it and fond of it, so there is no point in elaborating on the plot.the tape plays well in a now nearly obsolete vhs player.",1,80
substance and shadow: women and adduction: phenominal historical view of the woman's experience with addiction. a detailed view of addiction to include all substances. great for a text in a class or for personal knowlwdge. fantastic book.,1,37
"laughed until it hurt: this is the most entertaining book i have read in a very long time. i found myself continually reading exerpts to my friends around me because i just had the urge to share the humor. it was the kind of book that i pick up to read for only a few minutes, but end up reading it the entire way through. this book revives the senses and reminds us that even in the most dire circumstances, there is something to laugh about.",1,86
nice fan ...except....: i bought this fan to replace the same model that had gotten fried from a power surge/lightening strike. after setting it up i realized that the frequency the fan's remote works on is the same that the frequency of the remote control for my tv. whenever i press the volume button on my tv remote - it turns the fan on and changes the speeds on the fan. needless to say this has been very annoying and i have to make sure either the fan isn't plugged in when i don't want to use it or that i don't use the remote anywhere near the fan anymore when i am using the tv remote. this is annoying to say the least. i assume they changed the frequency of the remote on the fan since i purchased it the last time a couple of years ago. otherwise the fan itself is nice.,1,154
"bbmak rox... again!!!: in my opinion, bbmak hasn't written or sung a bad song on either of their cds. all of their songs r catchy and totally kick (...)_awesome!!! their new cd is just as good if not better than the 1st. you could play either of their cds over and over again and never get tired of them. i strongly recommend u buy this cd and if u don't already have the 1st one... get it!!! u won't b dissapointed!!! it even has the music video 4 out of my heart which is an awesome song and the music video's even better this cd totally rox and its definatly worth while 2 buy!!!!!",1,114

"love these boots: i love these boots. my mother brought a pair back from australia about 5 years ago and i thought they were so ugly. i finally broke down and bought a pair after listening to her brag about how warm they were - my feet are always freezing. well, they keep my feet warm and are soft and cozy. i wear my pants over them and no one seems to really notice that i'm wearing boots all the time. i wish i had a second pair to wear around the house.",1,93
"pure beauty: i was given full moon and the shrine as a gift months ago and appreciate it more as time passes. i love the way special music like this grows in my heart. this is an awesome composition from start to finish. full moon and the shrine is a crescendo of emotion. it begins in purity and ends in purity; but in between, it offers the listener the full spectrum of the rainbow. its sum total is all. what a lovely, eclectic blend of sounds! lovers of jazz and new-age instrumental music are sure to be pleased. its eclectism lends, at the same time, eccentricity. you may ask, ""how can full moon and the shrine be both eclectic and eccentric?"" listen and you will understand.soar my friends,soaring heart",1,129
one of his best.: to see jim carrey in a movie that was already a classic was a delight. well done! a newer way to enjoy an old story,1,29
animals: my kids totally enjoyed this book and have learned so much. they are eager to read this book and are amazed at some of the animal facts. we spend time together reading this book and i have learned quiet a bit. the pictures are amazing as well.,1,48
"softer sides vs. heavier: i actually preferred the slower tracks on this one... and fell pretty hard for them too. the heavier tracks are there but the softer the better on this one. scott's vocals, robert and eric's jazz-lounge rhythms alongside dean's talents sound absolutely superb in laid back fashion. undeniably deep songs.",1,53
"painful splendor: a mesmerizing memoir by the talented, vivacious elizabeth wurtzel. the pages fly by, the layers are unpeeled, and in the end the reader is left with a raw and very real sense of the addict and all her complexities. is she a brat? yes. but a fearless and brilliant one. great work.",1,54
"default fans: like them or not...this is a great cd.i'd never heard of default until a friend borrowed me this cd.after listening to it, i was hooked.",1,27
"great book, but not one of king's best: i am a big stephen king fan! i have read such books as the dark half, carrie, cugo, christine, and the shining. the dark half started out a little slow then picked up lots of speed that built up to the climax. i thought the ending could have been better and just a little bit more realistic. this book is pretty intense, and has a lot of gore!! but over all this book is very good!!",1,84
"so small, yet filled with huge ideas.: i didn't know what i was getting myself into when i started reading this. although this book is small compared to many influential books, it packs some big ideas that i'm still trying to wrap my mind around. if you like to think and want a perspective way beyond the norm, read this book.",1,61
"twelve southerners warn of their regions cultural loss: i thoroughly enjoyed this collection of essays by twelve southerners who write of the south's agrarian tradition and its temptation to abandon it for the rootless money-grubbing way of the industrial north. their prophecy that the south would join the mindless, generic and robotic industrial culture of the north unless she defended her roots in the soil has nearly come true. this book serves as a great treatise on what the south was really fighting to preserve in the war between the states; her agrarian culture. it is a must for those wanting a look at the true southern culture-not that of hollywood or her enemies in the north.",1,117
"all i can say is... wow!: if you love period pieces with a romantic element, watch this one! eddie redmayne was fantastic! his character will draw you in. the chemistry between redmayne and his love interest, played by clémence poésy, was spell-binding! pbs has done it again!!",1,47

"the evolution in metal: über alles continues the space odyssey that began with transmission from uranus with it's sci-fi style. now enter über alles. we are now into a very wagnerian space-opera. the music is furious, intense, and very breathtaking. the integration of industrial and metal music brought us to the mainstream ministry, then white zombie and then static-x. following the tradition of high quality industrial-metal, hanzel ünd gretyl can now claim the place of the best industrial-metal band. with the military-style third reich from the sun, the ultra-catchy ich bin über alles, the groovy komm zu ens to the decadant fury of ss deathstar supergalactic (listen it right now. i'm serious), this album is sure to please everyone who can accept that putting electronic into metal is a good thing. this is the evolution of metal, and bands shouldn't fear using technology to do their music. hanzel ünd gretyl does it incredibly.",1,153
"great mp3; needs work on the video and shuffle play flexibility: this ipod is great for storing your entire cd collection and still have plenty of space for your latest 100-2000 pictures to share with family and friends. i would like to see some improvements from apple on the following:1. video quality - the screen is small and the quality is not real great especially in fast moving action shots2. must use itunes - this is sad because there are better applications out there3. shuffle play is limited - it is difficult to set a shuffle play for anything smaller than the entire ipod or a playlist. for 2 - 4 gb that works ok, but when you have your entire cd collection loaded up, it is difficult to just play a particular genre or even artist.",1,137
"after reading this, i am convinced 9/11 was a scam.: i am an structural engineer. whoever wrote that other article is ignorant of steel buildings. there has never been a steel building destroyed by fire, including ones where explosions occured. as that other reviewer said, there is no way that the impacts on the top floors was large enough to pulverize the concrete. look at pictures of other buildiong collapses and you will see they look nothing like what happend at wtc. moreover, building 7 was built entirely differently from the twin towers, yet it collapsed exactly the same way?wake up and smell the coffee. sounds like that other ""engineer"" is cia or mosad plant.",1,115
"nice decorations: the good: glowing stars and planets make a dark room more friendly for kids. we used a starmap to arrange them on the ceiling, so there's proper constellations and everything.minor complaints: planets made of paperboard, glowing parts of planets very strange. as long as they're not getting handled a lot, they should hold up.",1,56
"great book: if your home library shelves have good old missionary stories, than this is a must read and must have!",1,21
benecol is amazing: my heart doctor recomended benecol smart chews as a way to get my cholesterol down a bit. he said it could lower it by 10%. i have been taking them twice daily now for six months and it has lowered my cholesterol by 18% or 34 points. this is huge. my cholesterol has never been below 192 and is now 158. great stuff and besides that they taste good.,1,72

"good stuff: these cds go right along with the ""that'll flat git it"" set for great listening. roots rock at its best. for the fan, this is new stuff. we've all heard the ""hits"" a zillion times and yearn for more new music. this is the good stuff.",1,48
life changing: there are few books i've read that are as thought provoking as well as entertaining as this one. i can honestly say this book made me a better person.,1,31
i like it...: this was not a need but a want. i am a gadget freak and i also like good quality kitchen appliances.works very well...to make my egg m?muffins. i wish it had a lid..but it does not and so i use a small plate to cover.t-fal...are you listening....how about a simple cover...with a simple handle... thanks :) this would give it 5 stars.,1,65
"marlon brando, pocahontas and him: neil young unplugged is gorgeous. each rendition of neal's captivating songs sounds poignant, nostalgic and beautiful. there isn't one note that goes to waste here. every song is just perfectly performed. like a hurricane, harvest moon and transformer man are my favorites. give this cd a try. it won't let you down.",1,57
"bel canto fan: i purchased this dvd with some misgivings, but accepted the earlier, favourable reviews.am happy with the stage settings and the music. columbara, as roger, is the pick of the cast, but the other males are all very acceptable without being great.unfortunately, veronica villaroel does not appeal to me. her higher range is tentative, unsteady and i wondered at times if she was confident that she had hit the right note.despite this i give the performance four stars as everything else was enjoyable.",1,85
"great book for serious golfers: this is one of the best book about short game. it's guide the reader on how to play various shot from 100 yards and in. pelz begins this book by show the reader why the short game is so import tance to golfer's score. he then guide the golfers on how to control distance from 100 yards with all wedges, to picth and chip the ball from around the green,and to play bunker shot. he does not only shows how to play all these shots but also include how the ball will react on the greens in details. this part make this book different from other short game books. pelz finished this book by showing how to choose wedges and how to practice effectively.however, this book is very large so it take much time to finish. it will be a very boring book if the reader is not so serious about his/her score.",1,158
"hey i really like this!: this is a good one laurnea! i have all of your cds, i think?.i have been following you sense ""betta listen"" your first on yab yum / sony. i have laurnea ii and new territory both on jvc japan.i can see the growth in this cd. and it takes you through a journey into laurnea's world . i really like the smooth happy feeling it gives me and i want to listen to it over and over again. i will buy it as a gift for a lot of people. her voice is amazing and comforting. everyone should have this in their collection.kellie",1,108
"interesting new direction...: simply put, this is an ambient version of ""cassette"".. but that is a good thing, because snd are positioning themselves slightly towards a larger audience by making their sound a little (just a little!) more friendly and less monotonous. imagine ""cassette"" with almost no kick drums, some pads (!) and some trace melodies. the second half is just fantastic. if you put that together with the best tracks of ""cassette"", then you would have one hell of an album.its worth checking out if their last album caught your ear..",1,92
"king of the south - gunit south: this is another great g-unit cd. its well worth your money. the beats are great and the lyrics too. every song has the potential to be a single. young buck was always the shadow of 50 and banks but now thanks to this cd he has made a name for himself.every single song in this cd is a stand out.make sure you buy this and also pop lloy banks cd which is just as good if not better. and for the future make sure to get the game in novmber and 50cent in february.ggggggggg - unit is running this thing, and putting other rappers out of bussiness.",1,114
"a wonderful alternative ending to the story: i would definitely recommend reading the book by the same title by andy zeller as well so you will know how the more realistic ending is like. however, i must admit that i love the alternative ending that was chosen for the movie. yes, it might be cliche & so alike a gay version of ""pretty woman"". but it is simply so sweet & perfect for a romantic at heart like me. it helps a lot too that all the main characters are so beautiful to look and can act well. my favourite character is actually the zany girlfriend, candy, who provides such an honest and funny view of how things work in hollywood. please definitely check the movie out when you in the mood for a sweet, romantic and funny drama full of eye-candies!",1,142
"excellent: my wife and i are very happy with the uniden tru 5885-2 telephones and answering system. the sound on the handsets is like that on a wired phone; very clear. and they work flawlessly everywhere in our apartment. there is no loss of performance or static anywhere. three speakerphones (each handset as well as the base) is a great convenience. also,we find the ability to store 100 different numbers in each handset a plus; especially when they are used by two different people.the answering machine also has excellent sound and is easy to use. was surprised to read that the message capacity is approximately ten minutes, and consider this a limitation. most of the current machines have a capacity of 15 to 30 minutes. however, if we keep up with the answering machine on a daily basis, the ten minute capacity should suffice.",1,144
"the best supertramp album: hardly a duff track on this record, which makes a welcome change from the band's other works. i used to listen to supertramp at college many many years ago and this is about the only album which has stood the test of time. the title track is a superb song",1,54
"fastastic story of adventure: a 13 year old girl confronting boys can be a problem, especially when the boy has all of the power of winter in this fantastic story of adventure.",1,32
"a nice taste of electronica: electronica has a lot to offer, at least when it's done right. this album has several excellent tracks on it. it is the soundtrack to a computer animation video. i have not seen the video, but i know that the soundtrack is worth the money.",1,50
"wrong point of view: my personal opinion is that people who say that the american version is worse because they use eye candy and special effects to scare us with only some jumps but no actually creepy parts definitely did not see both movies with the mindset of seeing two different movies. you have to realize that what scares americans is completely different from what scares people of any other culture in the world...every culture has a different opinion when it comes to fear. unfortunately, not everyone can freely watch two movies in different languages that have a similar plot but different methods of scaring and like the both of them. unfortunately, ringu and the ring cannot be compared because they were both influenced by their country.",1,127
"great album: i'm fairly new to latin music, but i do know a good voice when i hear it. i love betzaida's self-titled debut album. i listen to it at least once a week at work. though i ""no comprende espanol"", this album has encouraged me to begin learning so that i can better enjoy the album. i first heard ""te tengo que aprender a olvidar"" when i woke up from a nap and univision was on. i instantly fell in love with the song and impatiently waited until august for the release. snatched it up as quick as i could. i still have a lot to learn about latin music, but i truly enjoy this one.",1,117
"finally! a challenging cardio pilates dvd.: this is the closest i've been able to come to finding a dvd to replace the awesome pilates class i used to attend. since i moved to a new town i've been struggling to find a pilates class or dvd that isn't a ""10 minute workout."" this flows really well and mallett incorporates cardio well, which is what i loved about my old classes. i feel challenged by this workout. the ball is a new element, as i've always done mat pilates with a band or 3lb weights. i adjusted to the ball immediately. as another reviewer mentioned, i feel that the ball has helped improve my form.",1,114
enjoy the journey: let's take this movie into perspective. it's mission impossible 2...not the first...or the last. they're laying it out like the television series. each episode is different. each movie will be different and have a different feel to it...a different flavor. we can't be too critical about how it was compared to the previous film. the next one will be different still. enjoy the movie for what it is. a journey into a world that most of us can't go. the cinematography was very woo. it was fast paced and blended well with the soundtrack that accompanied it. the acting was well done and the story may not have been completely original...but it is still fun to see all the action that takes place from beginning to end. buy this movie to have a good time and enjoy what these people have worked so hard to create for the audience. a good cutting-edge cinimatic adventure film with loud music and exciting new stunts never before seen on film. enjoy.,1,171
have used before: couldn't find my disk when i had to reformat so purchased this one through amazon. makes setting up web pages very easy and i like the fact you can see what the finished page will look like or change it to html view if you want to manually add anything.,1,53
i love this collection...: i love this series collection. the playback has been clean as well as the audio. i've been eagerly anticipating its arrival and am not disappointed.,1,29
"takes stress out of dinner: this book has taken stress out of dinner. however, i use it more as a guideline because the recipes are not exactly healthy. i definitely subsitute.",1,31
california dreamin mammas and the papas: california dreamin mamas and the papas-60's dreamin music from my high school years. fun and sincere.,1,22
"interesting story: my son happens to love this series which is why we are still reading it. it is an interesting story line...but theologically speaking, differs from our family's beliefs. i have to stop and tell my son that i don't agree with parts of the book and we talk about how our beliefs differ. it has greek names which are hard for kids to read and also some difficult words to read in general- some of which i have to say ""son, i don't even know what that word even means!"" kids seem to love it; i just think it is ok.",1,103
"probably one of the best screenplay books ever written: i've read a few screenplay books and this one may be one of the best, plus it's a fairly recent publication, which counts for something, even though the screenplay craft hasn't changed much in decades. this book provides numerous tips on how to write a screenplay somebody may actually want to buy. it shows numerous references to actual movies, explaining key points in great detail. be that as it may, it didn't cover absolutely everything i've read about screenplay development, so i definitely wouldn't call it a ""complete book of screenwriting."" but you wouldn't need such a book anyway. if you don't have enough talent, time and motivation to write and market a screenplay, no screenplay book, complete or otherwise will be enough.",1,132
"informative yes - new no: although some of the pages in the book read like another famous author's spiritual guide, i still enjoyed this book. spiritual laws have become commonplace on bestseller lists, but they never get old.",1,38
great workout dvd set: i hate to exercise but like winsor pilates because it tones my body in just 20 minutes per day. previously owned this workout series in a vcr tape. decided to upgrade to dvd. i bought used and was plesantly pleased that the dvds were in good condition.,1,51
"worth it!: 48 days to the work you love is very good book getting you to focus on finding what you love and doing it. also, it introduces the concept of making deposits in multiple areas of your life (career,spriritual,financial,social,family,physical,etc). i have read many books like this in the past, but this one is by far one of the best.",1,60
"one of the best universal remotes: set-up was a breeze. it does take some time to key in all your components, but once you're done, it's easy as can be. doesn't take a tech genius to do this. would have gone for the 890, but cost is so much more for ir feature and backlight. remote is comfortable, and rechargeable batteries are a definite plus. logitech has every one of my devices, even for my a/v switch which caused me some concerns, but logitech had it. much better than i hoped. wife loved the simplicity of the remote. one-button push much easier to turn on devices. i currently have 9 programs for this remote. absolutely love this remote. can't live without it now.",1,123
jeff dunham ..... great comedy: this is the second of two dvd's out and i have them both. for good reason.i have just recently been introduced to jeff dunham's work and find it extremely entertaining. my wife and i didn't stop laughing through the whole skit and its not that easy to make me laugh out loud.... but jeff's humor hit that funny spot. looking forward to another new release.,1,70
"thinking man's hip hop: this is a landmark album in the history of hip hop. though it did not have the mainstream appeal of todays corporate rap machine, it enjoyed huge popularity. and was very important in terms of guiding hip hop into its concious activist, and spiritual movement. however, the album is by no means preachy. brother j is one of the most gifted lyricist of all time. he paints beautiful images with his metaphors and analogies which allow the listener to be immersed in a world of intellect and spirituality outside the eurocentric philosophies.beyond that- the beats are just banging. x clan ignited the use of old school(70's/80's)samples. but they go a step further and incorporate tribal rhythms which connect the modern urbanite to a time past when the wisdom of the ages was not lost. this album is a must for anyone that wants to hear truly inspired and purposeful hip hop.",1,155
great: it's big. it evenly dries my clothes. the lint trapper gets a tremendous amount of lint off my clothing. this is a great product.,1,25
thank you for the good book.: i thought it is easy to read and understandpuzzles. and more over it is very interesting.thank you for the good book.,1,27
"millennium: omg, i only have good things to say about this cd. every song is fabulous! although it took me a while to adjust to i need you tonight, now i love it. (even though, if you've ever heard any of their import songs, it's the song heaven in your eyes, with a different title.)someone asked me which was my favorite song and i had to really think about it. i would have to say, don't wanna lose you has to be my favorite, and that was a very hard choice because i love them all.brian littrel, god i love the way that man sings. he has been blessed with a magnificant voice! so brian l. if you ever read this, your voice is soooooo soothing!i highly recommend this cd. buy it, you won't regret it.",1,136
happy i didn't buy the expensive ones: a friend tipped me off to buy these cables instead of the expensive $60 ones at the store. they were easy and work great with my sony bravia. i have no complaints and have been using them for one month. i suggest investing in these before buying the other ones.,1,57
"nice model: this is a nice model when studying botany with younger children. i would have liked for the flower to have been made of a bit more sturdy material, but it will last through out study so it is fine. we used this in a science club with younger kids (ages 6 and younger) and they enjoyed being able to ""see"" inside a flower. the kids were a bit young to really understand what they saw when looking at a real flower through a microscope, so this one definitely fit the bill. i gave it four starts instead of five because while it is great for young children, it was a bit too simple at some points. having a bit more information would have been nice as well as a good educational insert which would have been doable for the price.",1,142
"my sergio mendez phase: sergio mendez has been with me since the mid 60's, when he started adding that samba beat to regular 60's tunes-the look of love, fool on the hill, and i believe his own, mas que nada. but i never knew that he had a purely instrumental album out there, and with antonia carlos jobim to boot. this was part of the exotic culture that your grandparents were into in the early 60's. my favorite track has to be the girl from impanema, practically a standard in the early to mid 60's. this is nice as background music for a quiet dinner party, or if you're just sitting back and reading from your kindle that you got from amazon. the liner notes indicate that there was more material that came from this meeting, but was unfortunately destroyed in a nj warehouse fire in '78, where atlantic had all their demos and sessions work stored. pity, because a deluxe version of this would be fantastic!",1,167
"3 inch memory foam mattress: i would have say that i,am very happy with this product ,i have a very tough time falling asleep .but wtih this matress pad i find myself falling asleep much faster, i would recommed this to anyone looking to fall asleep easier.",1,47
"i loved this cookbook: i must cordially disagree with the previous 2 reviewers who thought the recipes too rich. i made polenta with leeks and loved it! good recipes for quinoa. a lot to choose from and not all of them had cream in the ingredients.i did my usual drill of borrowing from library, trying a few recipes and then deciding whether to buy. i bought!",1,66
"farscape #1: premiere/i, e.t.: i loved this very much!!!! the more i watch this series, they better it becomes.",1,19
"perfect for small apartments: this chair is great if you have no space for a full size high chair. my 5 month old daughter enjoys sitting in this chair. i have it tilted slightly because she cannot sit fully upright yet. it is easy to clean; there are no little crevices where the seat meets the sides (unlike another brand). the chair is very sturdy on my kitchen chair, which has a little padding. i also like that it is wide - more stability. it is hard but not impossible for me to tilt so i am not worried that it will move while my daughter is sitting in it. we don't use the tray yet because my daughter is rather small, and i don't care for the toys.",1,129
"if you deep fry anything, buy one !: excellent quality and has many many uses besides in a deep fryer.the handle is always cool and the stainless steel basket won't rust.the basked is 7 inches across so it's great for dipping out shrimpand wings. does well on spaghetti and noodles also.",1,51
good product and great amazon service: i had been looking for a decent 2nd. carving set for a while when this one came up on special. excellent quality for the price. cannot fault amazon's service for quickly sending me a replacement set when the 1st. one got lost somewhere in the wilds of australia.,1,54

"awesome lens for the amateur photographer!: i took a few pictures as soon as i received this lens and was immediately impressed. i has always loved taking close up photos and intimate portraits and this is the lens to do that with. it is no canon l lens but it is just fine for what i need it for. i highly recommend this lens for someone who wants to get into macro photography, take amazing portraits or use it as a general everyday lens.",1,84
the best book on the topic!: this book contains the best information i have ever found about big island. i found many tips that saved me money and time and helped me made the best of our trip.,1,38
"wolf and iron: apparently written for adolescents, this book still has relevance for the adult population since it deals with the effects of economic melt down and survival as well as the interaction between man and beast.",1,37
"a must-have for the serious trader's library: a must-have book on trading. why? it really forces you to think for yourself. to paraphrase a well-know fishing analogy, teach someone a system, they trade for a while...help someone to think and they can trade for a lifetime.and trade is the key word, you are not investing, etc, but placing your psyche and cash on the line. each of the ""rules"" gives you the chance to think through a critical concept and come to grips with what can work with you.each ""rule"" is clearly and concisely developed. no bs or watered-down drivel. each is consistent within the larger picture.i could write more for you to read here, but your time would be much better spent reading jankovsky's 28 rules for yourself.",1,129
"very pleased: received my order for ""the ex"" and was quite pleased.it was even taller,and the base was larger (more stable), than expected.i really like the magnetic feature in the slots that prevent the edgesof the knives from running along the openings.",1,42
"good, inexpensive alternative: the guitar feels a little different than the official one. the spacing between the buttons isn't exactly the same and the opposite side is rounded. that being said, this has worked great for me. i didn't want to pay full price for another official guitar after having already spent so much to get the game with my first guitar, so i went with this and i am satisfied with my purchase. it has allowed me to play with two people and i have not had any problems with it. if you and all your friends are hardcore guitar hero players, then go for the official, but if you are a casual gamer or don't play on expert, this is a great way to allow two people to play without spending too much extra money.",1,137
"faster than tiger: solo les puedo decir que funciona mucho mas rápido que el tiger en mi mb mid'07. arranca mas rápido, cambio de usuario vertiginosamente y sin ningun esfuerzo y ademas la interface es muy bonita. simplemente lo mejor que haya vista(o) de parte de los desarrolladores de apple inc.",1,51
"send me green...!!!: maybe metallica's most popular album is ""master of puppets""...the songs are very popular in the gigs...there's a fast ""battery"", the heavy killer tracks ""the thing that should not be"", ""welcome home"", the fast ""damage inc."" (like ""dyers eve"" or ""metal militia"", a heavy track). ""leper messiah"" is a great song too...there's a riff written by dave mustaine from megadeth. the title track is a popular live track but i find it a little bit boring and overrated...still, it's a classic. the songs ""disposable heroes"" and ""orion"", an instrumental track are the only songs i wouldn't like to hear live...other are killer tracks.stars: leper messiah, the thing that should not be, battery",1,114
"a very good dear america book: i liked this book a lot. it was boring at first, but it got better. hearing about the titanic from a survivor would be really rare. there are funny parts, sad parts, twists and turns, and a little romance thrown in for edge-of-your-seat reading before the titanic sinks. margaret is a fourteen-year-old from england who is going to join her brother in america. she lived at an orphanage for girls run by nuns, and is chosen by sister catherine as a companion for mrs. carstairs and her dog. it is very exciting, especially the parts about the titanic just before it sank. a wonderful book!",1,111
"excellent, excellent, excellent: boot camp is absolutely the best sat preparation book i have ever seen. mrs. manning's style of writing in boot camp is captivating. she writes as if she were speaking in person to the student. her style used in presenting the material is so creative that the reader can't wait to get to the next page. all sorts of useful hints are given on how to master all of the material. when you buy this book, you will not be able to put it down, and you will be learning without even realizing you are. mrs. manning has a gift for bringing to the reader exactly what he or she needs in order to master the material given on the sat. if you want to inspire yourself, while perfecting your sat score at the same time, buy boot camp now. you will be very happy that you invested in such an incredible book.",1,156
"my favorite female artist: this is one of my top ten greatest cd's of all time.i love this young woman's voice .it is so crisp and clear.there are a lot of other singers that have been more succesfull,but are not half as talented as wendy.i had the opportunity to meet ms moten on a few occasions,each time she was exceptionally nice and easy to talk to.i only hope she has new music out soon.i really would like to hear something new from her. ''come on in out of the rain '' girl!!!",1,92
pooh and tigger too!: both child and parent friendly. nice pictures. 4 stories. excellent! my godson and his siblings adore it!,1,21
"this book is great.: it is good because it makes you think, it's not just there for pure intertainment. i also like the depth of the book and the details. it also lets you think on your own, letting you have your own opinions while she has hers. i highly recommend it to people who like to think.",1,58
great sound and brings back memories: the sound quality on this album is great on my kindle fire hd. i had this record album and loved it and now i can listen to it anytime i want! well worth the price!,1,41
"another adventure in history: i watched the sharpe series and have been reading the saxon tales. given my interest in the early middle ages i decided to try ""the winter king"" and again found that cornwell has created a realistic world in the past. he creates battle scenes that fit known facts about the times.while i found his arthur to be more idealistic and peaceful then the era would expect. he more then makes up for it with more realistic women then he has in the saxon tales and his merlin is cleaver creation. if this book ever makes the screen merlin would be a role better then most.sure wish this was the one picked by made for tv instead of the syfy channel merlin.",1,125
"great lens!!: i'm real impressed with this lens. i've been needing to get more reach for my wildlife photos. the dof and bokeh are wonderful.i use the tamron 200-500 with my rebel xt. i have very small hands, and i have no problems hand holding this lens at all. what i do is, when it is fully extended, i just put my left hand under the end of the lens to balance, and it's as easy as that.i only have it 3 days and i'm really enjoying it. my images are sharp!the only thing i did was change the contrast on my camera, which had been set to high, to normal.....the ""sun shade"" is a must in bright light, and really works well.if i chose to mount on my tripod, i have no problems. i have a bogen-manfrotto and it's sturdy enough to hold this big lens.",1,147
"i like bob's red mill whole grain bread mix: i have used bob's red mill whole grain bread mix several times. however, i found that if you add some dried onions,about 1/4 cup and some garlic powder it makes a delicious onion bread that i like much better.",1,48
"solid and heavy pizza slicer: i was a little concerned about this product after reading the reviews which indicated the unusual size. however, this pizza cutter is great. i have now used it on my own creation which i cook on a stone and on a pizzeria-bought pie that needed re-slicing. cut through them both like butter. the size does not get in the way and you really don't even have to press down too hard because of the solid weight of this ""pizza wheel"". i am very satisfied but i removed one star due to the fact that the wheel/blade cannot be removed. it would have been fairly easy for oxo to make this product with a removable blade for thorough cleaning and for ease of sharpening. i'm disappointed about this. if the bushing or rivet fails down the road, i will probably design my own removable replacement. last but not least, i really appreciate the quality of oxo products. i've got a kitchen full of them.",1,168
"bravo!: after using a french press with a glass jar at home, i came across this product which i obtained from handy house (beaver creek shop). as i use this on my sailboat, the fact that is an unbreakable product is key. the design is better than my home one as it has a filter on the pouring side, which keeps any grinds in the press (out of my cup).the service from the beaver creek shop / handy house was excellent. no whining about shipping to canada and at an excellent price. even a personal follow-up on the mailing and arrival of the package.well done!",1,105
"works ok: product arrived on time and in good order. the functions are in different order than they were on the older casio it is replacing. while it has a count down timer, it would be nice if that could be made to be continuous as opposed to restarting it each time. if it was continuous it would be helpful for making rounds by reminding you each time the rounds were to be started. it does lose 3 or 4 seconds every month or so. also found it interesting that you should not push the buttons when it is in the water, probably has something to do with sealing out the water. the display appears slightly larger than the older casio even though they are the same physical size, so easier to read and helps when i am running.",1,139
satisfied purchaser: i am very happy with my watch. the expansion band is the perfect size for my wrist... which was squeezed by my previous band. it is attractive and easy to read. good price. delivery was as promised. all in all a satisfying purchase.,1,45
"great part for your home audio system: this is a great part of your home audio system should you decide to hook your computer or other device with a minijack plug in to it. a good long cable (other lengths are sold both in a m hp-10 and in the thx series). if you are unsatisfied with your current speakers, and have a good hifi system, but lack the digital connections such as s/pdif out or optical on your system, this is the way to go.",1,86
"great book: this book is awesome, the best in the series. it not only shows new innovations in rowlings magical world that we all love, but goes much beyond this, showing changes and newness in harry himself. this book tells a coming of age story that we can all relate to, and is recommended for any reader of any age. there is just so much there, we can all relate. go get this book now if you do not already own it, and get ready to be amazed.",1,88
"a must read for everyone: i can't say enough good about this book. gavin de becker delivers an amazingly down to earth and easy to read guide to navigating in a world where violence can and does happen with plenty of warnings.he demonstrated, even in the opening chapter, things that i had felt very clearly but never had words to explain. seeing them put to terminology that i can use was so very helpful, and his willingness to be vulnerable and talk about his own history helps a reader to feel invested in the work he's doing. i can't honestly think of a person that couldn't benefit from reading this book - unless it's someone who already has.",1,118
"worth it for baker street and right down the line...: if you are a fan of mellow-early-70's music then this cd may be just for you, at least for baker street and right down the line. the rest of the cd leaves a lot to be desired, but it's not that bad. the other songs just don't give you that soul-tingling, melancholy, sentimental, lovey-dovey feeling to the extent that these two particular songs do. all in all worth the money.",1,80
the movie: i work at a production company currently developing this book into a film. i personally can vouch for the quality and insight into a family with a child who suffers from a very strange disease. and the value that terry's words contain and the spirit terry inscribes with visual images and witty dialogue within it's chapters are heart stopping. terry trueman excels at not just being a poet but being an author with a spectacular range of emotion. i can only imagine how the movie will shake and rattle an audience.,1,93
"unussually entertaining hig school romance: this movie is not perfect, but it has moments of poignant romance and others of absolute hiliarity. kirsten dunst was wonderful. this movie is a semi-musical farce. i mean farce in its proper usage: not a term of derision but rather the highest and hardest form of comedy (as distinguished from satire for instance). or put it this way- shakespeare-s comdies are farces. except maybe for the merry wives of windsor. a good farce is very very hard to do. and there are moments when this film descends into burlesque- and others when the humor gets clunky. despite its uneveness this is still an immensly entertaining film. even the minor supporting characters are a hoot (ed begley jr and swoozie kurts as the parents of our haplessly infatuated hero, for instance).",1,136
protected: nice filter and i do not take it remove it from the lens.... real protection and the colors it is really enhance,1,23
really cool book light: this is sooo much easier to read by than the conventional little clip-on book lights. the room stays dark but the page is lit and very readable. it functions as a book marker until you need to read by night light again.,1,46
"take that live: fantasic and fun performances of take that live. this is minus robbie williams but the vocals are strong and the sets are over the top. it has a few moments of corney, but overall it is watchable. i am not big on circus themed anything, but there is enough distraction and good harmonies that you can easily get distracted!",1,62
"great sequel to the millionaire next door!: if you haven't read stanley's ""the millionaire next door,"" you need to read it before reading this book. this title is an expanded, much more detailed treatment of the same subject matter stanley covers in his former volume. the author's research is amazing, dispelling many of the myths that surround the wealthy.if you've read ""the millionaire next door"" and are eager for more details of the same, buy this book!",1,77
"outstanding: an excellent singer in the same league as sara brightman. the production quality of this dvd is better than the recent sara brightman, live is las vegas. charlotte church fans will like this also. recommended",1,36

"best diapers!!: i only used luvs and parents choice with my first daughter because they worked the best. but with my 2nd baby we got a bunch of different brands for the shower. i was very impressed and satisfied with the huggies! they fit the best,they don't let moisture leak through like some do. i will not buy anything else anymore",1,61
greatest book on the subject in existence!!!: this is the greatest book that my family and i have ever found on the subject of child training! my parents raised me with it and i hope to do the same with my own children. i hope that this book will bring as much blessing to everyone who reads it as it has to my own family.,1,65
"gates 24715 fuel tank hose, 1 1/2"", 90 degrees.: this product is what it is supposed to be. it comes a little longer than what you might need, so you can cut it to fit. i have purchased two of these from amazon, and would again, although, i hope that i won't need to.",1,54
"my favorite: this book is my number 1 resource. it is written very well, and the way it is all laid out really works for me. i own several tarot books, but whenever i need help with a definition this is the one book i always end up turning to, it is very dependable. i also find the section in the back on card combinations (like runs of numbers, suits, ect.) very helpful. i would highly recommend this book to anyone learning the tarot.",1,84
"bombay 101: mehta provides a very human introduction to this incredible metropolis, keeping the narrative alive with a steady stream of seedy underworld nuggets. for instance, learning about the shadow courts of the underworld that resolve everything from property disputes to trade negotiations. it drags towards the end, but makes up for it in its overall illumination of this city. after reading this, my wife and i have put bombay at the top of our travel list.",1,77
"one shining moment: this is a great ""what-if"" tale. it tells the tale of a lowly rat that is transformed into one of cinderella's coachman. but there is more. this story is very innovative and amusing and you get a rodent's perspective on this classic fairytale episode with a few twists thrown in for good measure.",1,56
"it's about time!: all i have to say is that this was a great show that should have never been cancelled. even though we, the fans, couldn't get it back we sort of compromised and asked for dvd box sets. it took us about two years but our hard work paid off. this sounds like a great box set and it will greatly appreciated it my collection. the only thing i ask is that the unaired pilot be included in the third season, so everyone can have every episode. i have already preordered this set and i am sure to be happy with my purchase.",1,105
"great cd!: this is only the first recording i've listened to of the trout, but something tells me that this recording of schubert's great quartet is a winner. the sound seems extremely rich and has a 3-d quality to it and the interpretation seems dynamic and flowing. i've listened to it 4-5 times over, and it sounds especially good in the surround-sound environment of my car (using my car cd player). i'd say it is a gem of my hundreds-of-classical-cds collection. of course, maybe that's just because the trout is itself a great-sounding work, but rarely does a recording seem to stand out for me the way this one does.",1,110
its a miserable life: this is the best sabrina book ever. this is a must read if you like sabrina books,1,21
"1st time reader: first time reading this author and found the book very good. couldn't put it down, the plot was very good. would recommend this book",1,27
watched it once... bought the rest of the series immediately: the four episodes on this dvd are just an intriging warmup... if you like slow moving anime and not a ton of action this is for you... if your looking for fist of northstar anime this is probably not for you. the best comparison i can make is probably aeon flux.,1,61
hawthorne order: thank you for you response to my recent order. i will conitnue to order from you. also the order was received on time.,1,25
"great upgrade: i am not sure why some people had trouble with this version. i haven't run across any bugs or problems of any kind. maybe other people hadn't applied the updater or maybe their computer wasn't up to the challenge or maybe i just don't do the same things they do but my experience has been troublefree. i use the program in conjunction with coldfusion mx 7(also by macromedia) and the integration work well, too. maybe if people that talk it down could be more specific rather than just saying ""it's buggy"" i could test out their issues and see if i can duplicate their problems",1,107
"great find!: i helped my mom look for a particular song. found it in one of these cds and got more great songs. my mother is from guadalajara, jalisco and these cds take her back to her roots. she got to enjoy this great collection within a couple of days- a plus.",1,52
"great fun!: i agree with the other posters! this movie is one of my all-time favorite watches. it's just flat out funny. can't wait to get a copy. (i own 400+ dvd's, and i still pull out my vhs copy of this movie all the time! lol)",1,47
"very good book: this book is well focused to management people moving to voip, it has a good chapter introducing the subject but nothing too technical, in roi it gives very nice arguments to deploy it. best chapters i read were the ones talking about qos and sla. they were good and showed really well explanations about it.i would recommend this book to be bought by project people or to add to your library.",1,74
"poetry in the everday: i love the combination of singable melodies and clever (and sometimes even thought-provoking) words. winston clark's perfect arrangements and impeccable piano accompaniment provide highlights both for the wonderful (and, let's face it, some not-so-wonderful) songs. i have listened to ""i love a lad"" about two dozen times, and it still gives me goosebumps when she sings ""and one day it will sift away."" what a choice of words!",1,72
"1897 sears roebuck catalog: invaluable for the research and interpretation of an 1895 farmhouse! i take it with me, for the edification of interested guests, as well as for my own education in what was available for the victorian home...from buggy whips to clocks to glassware of the period.",1,49
just great......again!: when i was growing up mash just didn't do it for me. i was just to young to grasp all the subtle humor. now being an adult i cannot pass up a chance to see this masterful classic. i recommend this series to everyone. i only wish that they would make the production of each season a little faster. i want to see it all now.,1,68
"a commonsensical discussion of important issues: ``dr. death'' got his start with campaigns to allow death row inmates to donate their organs (currently organ donation is impossible). if you take a heart, a liver, two kidneys, two corneas, and bone marrow from a willing donor with a known execution date, and you can save quite a few lives with his death.it's common-sense arguments like these, not grisly death-obsession, that makes this book worth reading. i expect that some readers will find the sections on euthanasia distasteful, but the subject is handled carefully and smartly.for all his faults, kevorkian is a strong and articulate voice who is too often written off automatically as a crank and a murderer. read this book in order to balance your perspective, then judge him if you wish.",1,132
"from hip-hop newsletter #36: out of l.a.'s underground come the large crew known as la symphony.""composition no.1"" not only introduces the group but will hook you from the get-go. each crew member brings something different with ruff and rugged flows to more mellow, whiny tones. on the production end, jazzy sounds dominate with the constant inclusion of cutting and scratching. ""little shirts"" is the ""fine lady"" track which is real smooth and will stick in your head like glue. not only do the group represent hip-hop in it's purest state, but they expand on what the black eyed peas and jurassic 5 started. very promising debut that will launch la symphony into the hip-hop arena.",1,115
"it's quite simple, really: this is the single greatest record of all time. musically interesting and innovative, with a down to earth political edge.",1,24
"coming back into fashion subject matter: i discovered this book after reading the recent obituary on j.f. powers. now i'm recommending it to everyone. father urban is a priest who sounds more like a rotary member, a fund-raiser, a pr man. when the powers that be send him to the hinterlands, he bows to the inevitable. other victories seem to turn on him at the same time. hob-knobbing with the weathly, which at first seemed to benefit his order, turns into a nightmare in which he remembers his duty at just the last minute. this prose is so dryly humorous you must read it carefully to catch it all. you will become enchanted with father urban and sorry to leave him at the story's end. i wanted this story to go on and on.",1,134

"very good, but....: this movie was very good, but it really threw me off in the beginning when just ash and linda drive up to the cabin. where the hell are the other people? if you just glaze over the first 5 minutes, and skip up to where the last left off, when the evil gets right up in ash's face, you should be fine, because the movie is great otherwise from the part of the prologue with ash and linda. especially good is the scene when ash and the furniture break out laughing together!",1,95

"like revenge? best ending ever!!: i first read this book back in 1999 and recently dusted it off and read it again. one of my favorites to date.the main character, beverly highland has a such a hard and terrible childhood that you find yourself rooting for her and almost clapping for her towards the end. she's a woman that every woman can identify with on some level and you watch her grow up, get smart and concoct the best revenge you could ever imagine. she goes from being homely and timid to being strong, ambitious, shrewd, smart, plotting and a real diva.sure wish there was a ""butterfly"" club where i live! reading this book was cake and the ending was the icing. women of the world: read this book! it will make you feel stronger and even inspire you to do better for yourselves.",1,144

"show me that smile again...: i used towatch growing pains every week to see what kind of trouble or problems that ben has, since he is only a year younger than i am. now, to all of us who want to see the remaining seasons. what i read recently, is that good wholesome family shows like growing pains and boymeets world, are not big sellers in today's world so plans for future releases have been shelved. the best bet to get the entire series on dvd at an extremely reasonable price, is to buy it at [...] like i did.",1,100
"a steal for the price!: for the price...this is one hell of a deal! i was worried about it being to flimsy, not to worry...very sturdy for the price range! and it seems to be coated well...so i think it will go a long time without tarnishing! i highly recommend for the price point!",1,54

"wish these games were around when i was a kid!: my 5 year old son just loves this playset, my husband also loves to play it with him. it is so cool, there is one section where you clear the path for the airplanes to land, (you are driving a snowplow). another part where you have to feed all of the animals, which is really a lot of fun.i did buy tonka monster trucks cd that is supposed to be compatible with the digs n rigs playset but the requirments differ, so if you do buy another cd, be sure it will work on your system, i thought if d&r;'s worked, so would the compatible cd-wrong!:)overall, the best cd/playset my children have and they have a lot! :)",1,128
"a high-quality piece of software: photoshop is excellent for what it is: a high end, professional piece of software. that is to say, it has a good range of features and is very flexible, capable of producing anything to which you set your mind.however... because of the depth of features, it can be incredibly difficult to use at first, and even the simplest tasks can take an age to perform if you aren't fluent with the software!! in that respect, it scores low for ease of use, but since it is probably not intended for the amateur user, it would be unfair to let this count against it.don't be intimidated by this -it'll become easy once you've done a few tutorials, and once you've mastered it the world is your oyster- but be prepared to have learn first!",1,138
"sturdy, and solid wood...: this item looks great. the finish is a rich dark brown. the size surprised me a little though. from the picture, i kind of expected it to be a little taller and not quite as wide, but i am even happier with the actual dimensions, as it fits even better than i thought it would in the space i bought it for.surprisingly, it has a lot of pieces, and took me about 45 minutes to put together by myself.",1,83
"best bang for your buck: i bought these a few months ago as a replacement set for my ipod. i was looking for something that would block out sound yet was still easily portable. i found both attributes in these. with the volume less than half up it blocked out all of the sound in a moving vehicle including conversation. the only problem i've had with them is that since the silicone has begun to really form to my ears, they tend to either wander out of the canals or get stuck in there. it's no real problem, though, so i'll keep using them until they just completely die. definitely a great product and the best sound i've ever heard form earbuds.",1,122
"great ideas.: i've been gathering and saving ribbon for years - now i have some great ideas for how to use some of it! this book has so many projects that i almost don't know where to start, but my favorites are the greeting cards - they all look so professional and elegant. thanks, heidi, for another ""simply beautiful"" book.",1,60

whimsical holiday music: john denver and the muppets provide whimsical holiday songs to balance with the more traditional music you may already own. this cd is a delight.,1,28
"a fantastic, startling book that challenges conventional wisdom: as it's subtitle implies, freakonomics is a book that reveals the hidden side of everything, and goes beyond conventional wisdom, and uses economics to answer some interesting, provocative riddles, such as whether sumo wrestlers or teachers cheat, whether the name you give your child influences how successful they grow up to be, what influenced the huge crime drop in the 1990's, and why most crack dealers still live with their mothers. almost all of the questions grabbed me, and compelled me to keep reading, and i found this to be a very refreshing read, with some very controversial, and interesting topics addressed. this is a must read for any avid fan of non-fiction!",1,121

"touching and heartfelt: i rated this movie 4 out of 5 stars based mostly on the heart-touching quality of it. it doesn't much matter if the ending is confusing and questionable. the ending just denotes that we all have spirits who need to fly, not be immobilized by an uncurable disease. if you watch the movie closely, there are some very artistic qualities about it, such as when elijah wood is bouncing the ball against the wall and there is a star of light shining between him and the wall. i enjoyed the acting, except (slightly)for jeanene garofolo.",1,98
"a fantastic president: we purchased this title as an audio book to listen on a driving trip we took this november. it proved to us what a great president and friend we all had in abraham lincoln, and what he did not just for this country but for mankind in general. i read a great deal of books about history and this one truly stands out.",1,66
great movie for kids of all ages: my daughter absolutely loved this video. we especially enjoyed reading it with the video. my only wish is that they made the sound available in french.,1,33

"love this!!!!: i love, love, love this show. i really hope abc brings them back for another season, it's a great show, but not for younger kids. if you liked desperate housewives you'll love this show, (i never really watched d.h.) it also has lots of stars you know from some great shows. i don't think i saw a single episode that didn't make me laugh! not just me either, my father who is a walker, texas ranger fan though and though loved this show. you don't have to take my word for it, see for yourself. i give this show 5 stars if i could it would be 10!!",1,110
"best overall performance for running earphones: i have now run with these earphones about a month (~100 miles). they replaced my ipod earbuds.the good:1. sound quality is excellent. there are times when i am running that i can hear parts of the music that i don't necessarily hear using my bose at home in my living room. it provides excellent reproduction of the full range of sound.2. they don't fall out of your ears. not once.3. you can wear a hat because the band goes around the back of your head, under the normal area for your hat.4. another reviewer mentioned wind noise but i don't find this to be any different than my old ear buds.5. the little clip on the wire attaches to your jersey and prevents a lot of tugging on the wires.6. the neon green makes it easier to find them when they are thrown around the house.the less-than-good1. they are tight enough to cause some ear discomfort with long runs.",1,165

"eternity..awesome: having listened to this cd a number of times, i find it to be delightful. all though the first 3 cuts are a little hard to understand as they are sung so softly, the rest are really great!to me the music has such a cool mix, a sureal sound that kind of just floats along. and lets the mind wander. the instrumentals are very fresh and well played. i find this cd very enjoyable and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a new and exciting listening experience. i can hardly wait for the next cd! i thank you for letting me express my views.j head",1,108
"brilliant take on carmen: matthew bourne's car man is a simply brilliant redo of the classic opera of the (more or less) same name. the wonderful music is all there, the plot shifted to a western us auto repair shop (from cigars to auto parts, hmmm), and as with all ballet, no spoken dialogue. but i found it simply wonderful to watch, the dancers erotic without a doubt but in a highly entertaining way. if you like the music, or if you like dance, and especially if you like both, give this a try.....",1,94
"darkly beguiling: any collection of robert w chambers's ""king in yellow"" stories is a rare and welcome gift, and the best of those stories--""the yellow sign,"" ""the repairer of reputations,"" and ""in the court of the dragon""--are included in this volume. curiously, however, others are omitted in favor of tales that, though quite good, simply don't seem to be part of the kiy cycle. the missing stories, in this reviewer's opinion, are as follows: ""the prophet's paradise,"" ""the street of the four winds,"" ""the street of the first shell,"" ""the street of our lady of the fields,"" and ""rue barree."" had the current volume included these tales, i would have given it the highest possible marks. still, it is an excellent collection that i highly recommend to anyone interested in the work of the inestimable and terribly underrated robert w. chambers.",1,141
"manchester lads: well, i have to say it, the geasers from manchester have done it again (its a little ironic to have a nyc photo on the front cover). this album is brilliant, to put it simply. oasis with that famous beatles touch again, but a little slower than previous album - mostly whats the story. simple lyrics but musically it is excellent, possibly from the changes in the band lineup. basically, get this if your an oasis fan!",1,79
"the standard: this was one of the better books i've read on vc. extremely well researched, very informative, though it took awhile to read. recommended.",1,25
"a good grinder: we have 5 of these. my wife likes them because they are easy and dependable. they don't leave salt or pepper on the table (most important). you can easily see whether it's salt or pepper. fresh ground salt, ""sal du mare"" ""gross"" (french for ""course"") is much better (and saltier) than the stuff with the little girl on it. and a good black pepper is always better fresh ground. be careful not to loose the spring if you adjust the grind. it has a tendency to pop out.",1,91

"the most comprehensive book on small caps: mr. pradhuman has done a fantastic and thorough job of explaining everything you ever wanted to know about small cap stocks. admittedly this book is probably more for professional investors than for individuals, but it is a must if you are a serious small cap investor. when you read this book, you will understand why he is wall street's #1 ranked small cap strategist.",1,71
"fun light reading: making up for lost time was a fun, light summer read. there were parts that would make you laugh outloud. i would recommend this read for anyone who wants a light, fun, lesbian romance. i actually tried the bread pudding recipe that is listed before one of the chapters and it worked and was so delicious that i think i have found my new holiday dessert to bring to dinner! enjoy!",1,74
"very nice: i liked this perfume alot and so does my daughter. i would not say we will specifically go out and repurchase this unless it is on sale. this was a great deal and we enjoyed the fresh and clean scent which was not sweet or too perfumy, very nice.",1,51
"b movie fun.: this is a over the top b movie with nick cage featuring his usual bad haircut. nick , long hair looks bad on older guys bro! the movie was shot in 3d and looks great though. the one star reviews have missed the point on this movie, it's pure silly fun and that's all it is. with nick cage busting out of hell to save his daughter from a evil cult leader. what were you expecting high cinema? no, you get a fun b movie that delivers lots of action in 3d. it's a beserk movie too with outrageous scenes like nick cage shooting people while he's having sex. if you don't like b movies then stay away from this one, but if you love good ole over the top b horror then sit back and drive angry. this is lowbrow drive in type of theater to be sure but i liked it. i also like high brow in my defense! the effects are great and this was shot in 3d , not processed in 3d so it looks better than alot of 3d movies out there.",1,190
"simply the best concert ever!: my mom introduced me to fleetwood mac when this reunion concert came out in 97. i am 14 now and i must say this is the best concert i have ever seen! stevie nicks and lindsey buckingham are incredible. from the first moment on when you hear the beginning of the awesome opener ""the chain"" you know this concert is gonna be great. i love gold dust woman on here, i can't believe they didn't put it on the cd! silver springs, rhiannon, and landslide are other high points for our beloved stevie, while go insane and big love are 2 songs lindsey is incredible on. buy this dvd, you wont be disappointed. fleetwood mac rules!",1,121
"the next turn...: depeche mode redefined themselves once again with this release, adopting ""real"" instruments, going so far as alan wilder's learning to play the drums. while this release doesn't pack the song for song punch as it's predecessor ""violator"" did, the style makes this a more interesting album. it's this constant reinvention that has kept depeche mode around for nearly 20 years.as for the songs, my current favorites are ""condemnation"", ""mercy in you"", ""one caress"", and ""walking in my shoes"". this, to me, is the third major turning point in the band (the first being after ""speak and spell"" and the second being around ""some great reward"" and ""black celebration""). while this album is good, their subsequent release, ""ultra"", is superior in almost every way and a strong contender with ""violator"" for dm's top album.i like all of dm's music and it's this varying style that makes them one of the most interesting bands of the era.",1,158
"rock memories: i'm giving the rock almanac: top 20 american and british singles and albums of the '50s, '60s, and 70s five stars because it is a great trip down memory lane. i used to check this book out of the local library for years when i was a kid. the book compiles a listing of all artists who hit both the uk & american singles and albums charts from 1964-1973 and the chart position of those songs and albums.",1,80
"excellent comeback: this is a very good album. cold were having some issues a while back, the singer in rehab and the guitarist leaving the band for evanescence. in my experience very few bands make albums as good as the last one. although not quite as good as ""year of the spider"", it is still a very good album especially considering the things they've been through. my personal favorite track - ""ocean""",1,72
"just plain comfy!: i requested (and received) a pair of these last christmas in the ""cognac"" color. wow. i found them to be so comfy that i went out and bought another pair for myself in black!i especially like to wear slip-on shoes when flying ... easy to get them off and on quickly when going through security; and then, after we're airborne i can slip them off my feet and put them back on before landing without having to reach down or lean forward! makes for a more relaxing flight.the 'gator' finish is a nice distinction, too. highly recommended. very comfy.",1,102

"nostalgic and beautiful: i purchased the 2nd edition a couple of years ago and enjoyed it from cover to cover. i loved the stories behind the coins, and the large images of the front and back of each great coin.early last year i gave away this book, and am sorely missing the beauty of it for a year now. i have looked through jeff garrett's encyclopedia of gold coins at the local bookstore, and strangely, i find that this book is way better. the encyclopedia feels more like an oversized redbook, while this item feels like a great work of art.i am looking forward to receiving the new 3rd edition. i called whitman books and their customer service rep told me that it should be ready by dec. 20th. as to when it will be ready from amazon, i do not know. but i am truly looking forward to the new 3rd edition.",1,153
rage rocks: i have only had this cd for about a week. one of my friends told me about them so i bought it. at first i was unimpressed; but the more i listened the better it got. rage is now my most likly favorite band and would recomend this cd to any one.,1,54
dogg pound gangsta' 4 life...whens crooked i cd coming out ?: death row gots a collection of some real gangsta' s**t still on their shelves and their latest dogg pound 2002 is worth the money. but ... if you know your dpg cds then you would know that this cd took basically a lot cuts from the latest daz dillinger cd and the latest dpg cd. but either way this cd is worth buying just to hear some new (old) s**t from the dogg pound.,1,85

"one of the best soccer coaching books, unique in presentation: this book is just great. i knew as soon as i picked it up, it was easy and fun to read and had the kind of info i needed. i coach two kids soccer teams and i got many great ideas to help my practices. lots of books are just pages and pages of drills, and others are just theory. the nit-pickers who picked on one page out of this book they did not agree with are missing all the other great stuff here. no book is perfect, but i got more usuable ideas from this book than i have from any other, and i've read scores of them.",1,119

"virtual desktop use: if you are considering this for a virtual desktop, this version is perfect and affordable. i ordered vmware fusion and just followed the easy guide and after about 30-40 minutes everything was loaded, copied and finalized automatically.i gave a rating of 4 stars because i prefer the mac system over it, but for the price, and what i am using it for, it is perfect. i would only use this version over vista and others because your mac will run quicker. eventually you may want to have at least 2gb of ram, but i am using 1gb which is recommended and it is fine.a note if you get vmware. it has a seamless ""unity"" option where you literally could not tell you were in xp. once in that view mode, just click the application tab on the top and xp is at your fingertips!enjoy!",1,147
"costly but worth it: i long quit listening with my sr-60s because of the pad discomfort. now they are so old the pads were turning brown anyway, so i looked into replacements. with a little bending up of the head-piece, these l-cush's fit great, and i can listen to excellent sound without being tortured by the way they feel on my head. the price seemed a little excessive, but after all this time it is like getting a new pair of grado's for $25. really not a bad deal, and i couldn't find any other way to rescue these headphones.",1,100

"brothers and sisters: undoubtedly, this cd is fascinating. brothers and sisters (the song) has an excellent guitar background part, and chris martin is well chris martin, singing well and not electronically supported like many modern artists of the day. easy to please is a slower song, that shows martin's excellent range vocally. only superstition is an upbeat song, one of coldplay's better songs. coldplay is a skilled band and this ep proves it. though as great a cd it is, i am compelled only to give it 4 stars because the 3 tracks. however, this is still a very great cd to get.",1,103

"absolutely brilliant!: this is not only one of the best punk songs ever recorded, it's one of the best songs period. this song is as close to perfection as you can get, both lyrically and musically. you would think that an 18 minute song would be boring at times, but not this one. the changes in tempo and the scathing political commentary keep your interest the entire time. this is a masterpiece.",1,72

"alas, they are no more...: digital poodle were one of the truely great industrial/techno band to come out of toronto in the 1980's. ""work terminal"" is a a very good example of the diversity of this band, the two versions of ""soul crush"" being a prime example. when zoviet france played in toronto at the rivoli, digital poodle were the back-up band and one thing lead to another and lo and behold we were given a wonderfully innovative version of this originally very abrasive track.well, here are digital poodle in all their glory before they crossed over into the murky waters of tecno-ambient land with their new band kinder atom (which is still pretty good as far as that goes...). digital poodle rock, so go and buy this album!",1,129

"you will cry at the end: i saw this movie when it first came out, just recently watched it again, and still felt the same way at the end, i cried because i was so happy. this is a great gift for mom's everywhere. anyone who knows what moms really go through for their kids, the endless hours they work to put food on the table, to make sure their kids have clothing, and how they suffer when there is something wrong with their child or have to be away from them, will want to see this movie.others may see the issues with immigrants into the us from mexico but as i have learned in a recent history class in college, americans used to cross over into mexico illegally when they discovered how beautiful mexicans and mexico are. they married mexicans to stay in mexico before the us army illegally crossed into mexico and started an illegal war with mexico, the mexican - american war. most of the western half of the us used to be mexican territory.",1,178
"a great book for beginning programmers...: this book seems to get poor reviews for some reason. this book is a great value because of its price and easy to use format. it is true that this book seems to be geared for beginners, but visual basic is a pretty beginner style of programming. if you have programming experience, you may want to try more challenging books. if you are new to visual basic or programming altogether, this book is for you. it even comes with a cd which gives you a visual basic 6.0 program to use! overall the value is super. how many computer text books with the program included can you find for this reasonable of a price. so as others may find this book to ""simple,"" i like the overall value, easy readability, and format of this book.",1,141
nice colors but a bit heavy: the colors in this comforter are beautiful. for fl it is a little heavy at night. i purchased the full/queen and attempted to wash it in my large capacity washer and it was way too bulky. you will have to take it to a laundry mat or dry cleaners if you want to wash it.,1,61

"this is ""the"" ant book. look no further: as an adult, i bought an ant farm from good old uncle milton. i was so excited about my ant farm, i decided to make this into a personal science project, and purchased this book. if there's something you want to know about ants, this is the book. it made ownership of my ant farm much a greater pleasure. i should also mention that it made great use for the occasional escaping ant. it certainly isn't for kids unless that kid is of high school age, and very interested in becoming a biologist.",1,101
"elegant but limiting: nice snug hold for your treo and high quality construction & feel; however, don't plan on using most of the device functions while it is in the cradle. the holster prevents you from opening the lid, accessing the jog dial, or accessing the outer function buttons while the treo is in it. you can however put the phone in the holster with the lid open if you need to access the screen (e.g. i use this holster as part of my car mount). the buttons you can easily access include the up/down buttons for declining calls and the power/volume switches on top. overall a very classy design for most purposes.",1,113
"works well, but had a crack: the cd itself works fine, and it's not scratched or anything, but the cd cover has two cracks on it. i ordered it new, and it even had the plastic covering but it managed to crack. but other then that, it was good. it came in really early, too!",1,55
more ruby please: i figured out who the killer was early on but it didnt spoil the story. i really like china bayles. she is cool. however if i could talk to ms albert i would ask her to please include more of the ruby character and ease back on the sheila!! i think ruby rocks!! but i liked this book and i like this series. the herb info is cool too. i am reading these in order so i have a few more to go. i have enjoyed them all.,1,91
a wonderful book full of wise knowledge for young and old: this book is wonderful. don't let the reading age level stop you from sharing this book with a younger child. my 7 year old son and i would read several chapters nightly. we both loved the book and the time we spent together. there is wise knowledge in this book for both the young and old. we hated to end it. now we can't wait to read the next one!!!!!,1,81

"well, i'm impressed: i'm a new fan of manga, and it's partly because of ""yu-gi-oh!"" it's got an unusual story, fun characters (joey's kinda cute..), and is just plain different. i just keep reading it over and over and it never gets old. i like it. you'll probably like it. go ahead and buy it.",1,55
"spider-man is back!!!: after spider-man 3 i was so glad to hear that they were going to reboot the series! i don't know who thought that garbage (spider-man 3) would be good, but it literally made my worst movies of all time list! i was never a big toby mcguire (sp?) fan, and i think andrew garfield plays a much better peter parker. my only complaint about this movie is that they had to rush through the origin portion of the story. since the origin of spider-man had already been established in the previous films, that part of the story seems rushed and incomplete here. had this been the first spider-man movie, and the film would have had the opportunity to develop a better origin, i feel like it could have been the best spider-man movie yet. however, they could be saving part of the origin story for the sequels.",1,150
"""chop, chop the king, the king!!!"": all i can say is wow! i was amazed when i rented this film and put this into my dvd player. the costumes, make up, and the acting are all superb! i could tell that a lot of thought went into making this quality movie.indeed i am a patriotic american and i do know that george iii is to blame for our american revolution, but i felt sympathetic towards the king in this film.underneath the savage, rigid, and tempermental ""insanity"" of the king, george iii did indeed have a heart and a conscious that can be seen in bits and pieces in many scenes. i actually found the prince of wales (prince regent) to be a ruthless snake that was king in ""name only.""there are some great scenes and shots of windsor castle, the houses of parliament, and st paul's cathedral. compared to the real and dysfunctional house of windsor, george iii and the house of hanover will give you a real royal treat in this film!",1,173
"works as advertised: i recently purchased two units, one for a 6-inch jointer and the other for a 10 inch contractor's tablesaw whose factory-supplied mobile base didn't last. both units assembled quickly and operate smoothly and silently. package includes spare nuts & bolts in case a few get lost. these bases make a small shop workable, allowing effortless machine movement to accomodate material & workflow, facilitate clean-up, and change arrangement to accomodate new ""toys."" caveat: unless you have help to lift heavy machines into the assembled bases, it is necessary to assemble the bases around the machine; however, by tilting the machine up on a few 2 x 4 blocks, there is plenty of ground clearance to do that easily. a well-designed, simple, durable product that works as advertised.",1,129
"readable theory!: springer's book delves into the changing nature of desire and the body in the face of new media technologies. the examples she uses are usually well known and her language is clear and concise. unlike most cyborg theory, this book is fun and enjoying to read.",1,48
"vince clarke has the midas touch: from depeche mode to yaz to erasure, everything vince clarke touches turns to gold. this compilation provides all the evidence necessary to bestow upon clarke the title ""synth god"".the biggest hits are ""little respect"" and ""who needs love (like that)"", but each song stands on its own as a great new wave composition, based on the powerful and unique vocals of andy bell and the fantastic synthesizer soundscapes (all 100% analog!) of clarke.""victim of love"" (my fave), ""oh l'amour"", and ""stop!"" are other highlights on this cd, which is well worth the money for any fan of 80s music.one other note: erasure has had several albums after the release of this compilation (most notably the masterpiece ""i say, i say, i say"", in 1994), so ""pop! 20 hits"" cannot be said to be representative of their career as a whole. still, it's worth owning for its summary of the band's first decade of production.",1,160
slumberjack kodiak sleeping bag: this sleeping bag is the best one i have ever used. it only got to about 20 deg but it was no problem for this bag.its pretty heavy but thats why its so warm. many configurations to choose from. large zippers prevent jamming.i really find it hard to believe they quit making this bag. i would buy another as a spare if i could find one.not for backpacking and and best camping bag you will ever use.[...],1,81
"tresor didn't soar.: i had tresor before and liked it a lot. but it has been years since i purchased additional product. what i received doesn't have a lasting fragnance and i have to ask people around me if they can detect the perfume. most say yes, but i can't smell it on myself. maybe it is just me. i love fragrance and even put a jot under my nose so i can keep the scent surrounding me.",1,78
"number the stars: i read the book number the stars. it was a very good book. i really liked all of the characters in the book. the main character did not seem to bug me at all. well the book is about a war going on in denmark, that is were they live. they are taking away all of the jews and so people are hiding them in there houses. so that is a little about the book. i rated this book a 4, because sometimes in the book i would be confused on what was going on. like the author did not really explain some of the things as well as she could of. but over all i thought it was a very good book!",1,126
"all dancers are students and teachers!: this is a wonderful addition to the literature on ballet. the auther makes her apologies in the beginning for not being able to include some noteworthiy teachers, but the ones she was able to cover are great. the information provided gives us valuable insight into the aesthetic principles of these great dancers and teachers. this should be useful to all dancers, whether they teach or not. some very esoteric facts can be found here as well, such as why balanchine likes the fingers and hands held the way he does and why many don't like it that way. i had taken some classes with a mr. schabel and discovered his claim to fame in these pages. the great jean babilee is even discused. you might also get some good ideas for further reading in this book as i did.",1,145
"great companion book: i was assigned readings in world christian history as textbook for a class at the perkins school of theology. the book is a compilation of historical documents, preceded by short introductions that place the documents in context and tell why they are important.if you are reading this, you are probably interested in church history. if you really want to get into the subject, you will need this book or another one like it.",1,76
"great!: it's a great toaster! unlike most of the ones we owned in the past, this does not make a mess (crumbles everywhere!) we like the design and functionality of it!",1,31
soldier gun: i like the station that came with it. the soldering gun works great. the quality is excellent and i enjoy using it.,1,24
great bargain: this is the second braun i have owned. the first one lasted 20 years. at $29 this is a great buy. so far the battery has lasted a long time - one month with no recharging. the shaving head works well. shaving takes about the same time as the other braun. the trimmer is okay but the feel on my skin is a little rough.,1,67

"i love the garlic roaster: i love the garlic roaster. i use it often because it is so easy to use and the garlic can be used so many different ways. i can spread it on bread and crackers or put it in mashed pototoes or soups. it is a great product. i bought one for my son, my daughter, my friend as a hostess gift and my sister, they all love it too.",1,74
"the coen brother's are back: i had a bad christmas and was sick of the drama. i wasn't sure what to expect from the movie ,because burn after reading was so terrible( in my opinion). and no country for old men was well written, but the ending left me angry. this film plays like a spaghetti/western/comedy believe it or not. jeff bridges doesn't even try to be john wayne, instead he plays the part like a skilled comedian ,but treads softly enough with the jokes so as not to become cartoonish. all throughout the movie, they play differant versions of leaning on the everlasting arms.which is a interesting foil to the violent story unfolding on screen. the only complaint i have is matt damon, who i usually like is very annoying, and i kept wishing his character would die already.i smell an oscar nomination or two for bridges or the very brilliant young ms. steinfeld,(mattie ross) i think is she plays her cards right,she could end up in the ranks of meryl streep.",1,173
"very good easy read, lehrer very underated as author: i have read several lehrer novels. i believe he is a very underated author. all of his novels are very good. others here have summarized the book. lehrer does not high brow you, plain simple writing, easy on the reader. he usually has very good historical research interwoven into his novels. you feel good after reading one of his novels. the book is more about friendship and a description about mental hospitals in the 1920's. it is a good read.",1,89
"steve vai the ultra zone: steve vai did a excellent job with this album. most instrumental albums are just showcases for the musician to show his chops, but in this case vai wrote the music wonderfully. this is an enjoyable album for non-guitar fans too. all the notes are played with feeling and emotion. there is also a two great tribute songs, frank which is a tribute to the late frank zappa is a beutiful ballad. then jibboom which is a song inspire from scuttle buttin by stevie ray vaughn. windows to the soul is a masterpiece which i thought was the best song of 1999. steve vai is a combination of technique, emotion, and creativity.",1,116
"good for the money spent: this was worth the money i spent, which was about $3. i would not pay any more than that, it's simply not worth it. the ""chain"" (really just some plastic beads) is a lot shorter than i was hoping, but it's easily removable so i will attach a longer chain. it looks authentic enough, and any real pirates fan will know what it is.",1,69
"definitely worth watching!: there's a lot more to this man than what is in this movie. but for a racing ""idiot"" such as myself i still found the movie to be very well done, informative and captivating. i knew nothing about senna before watching the movie and now i just want to learn more. i would happily recommend this movie to others and watch it again myself. i wish i would have seen it in theaters when it was in town.",1,81
"superb: i am guessing, but shlomo ketko was my supervisor when i spent a year at hebrew university for a ''one year israel training course... etc.'' in 1976, and the author was thorough, very knowledable, communicative, in short, had all those qualities needed to convey a message to a wide audience. since the title of his work corresponds with my experience i can only guess that it is highly readable, i know for sure it is based on a long and deep understanding and love for his topic!",1,88
"soooo cute!: as another reviewer stated, these are small but the product is listed as 5"". these are so cute and we've served small pieces of cheesecake on them and used also for little appetizers. nice for a few nibblys....just a nice, cute and inexpensive addition to the eastside collection.",1,50
best travel mug: this mug is excellent. keeps liquids hot and contained. simple yet sturdy design prevents leaks. solid construction means it will last. highly recommended.,1,26
under the rainbow: i was excited to find this movie. my husband and i loved it when we first saw it.glad to be able to share with a new generation.,1,30
wow!: beyond outstanding. this book has the potential to flip the world upside down and create a new set of rules. we need to see more from this new and brillant writer. purchase a copy today and encourage your friends and family to do the same.,1,46
"worthwhile hagiography: written by (or, more probably, for) the founder and ceo of starbucks, this is, of course, corporate hagiography. but it's nevertheless a fascinating story of how the entrepreneurial spirit can thrive even outside the high-tech arena. it's also a good read. it will also change the way you think about coffee. recommended.",1,54
"kiss- double platinum, terrific album: this is, to me, one of kiss's finest releases. as i've grown up i've heard too many people bad mouth kiss and i call these people ""musical snobs"". they tend to listen only to things like progressive rock. i like kiss because they played from the heart. yes, the music is not be technically superb in most ways but they did have some very original ideas on this cd like the guitar playing of ace frehely and the little boy voice- very cute. one of the finer songs on the cd is ""hard luck woman"" written by peter criss. peter is a terrific drummer. he's no carl parlmer but then carl palmer was no peter criss. if you like hard rock and want to add to your audial history from that repertoire then you may just want to get a hold of this cd.",1,149
does the job: i had a multiple gang power supply for my pedals. i have a zoom au2 that wasn't receiving enough juice to make it work right..so i bought this little puppy. now my zoom multi effects pedal is happy...and so am i.,1,44
simply so e of the best reading i have come across: fantastic! i read many books but few are as good as this entire series has been. i have read the series 4 times over and love it every time i read it,1,43
muy bueno: lo mejor es que tiene varios compartimientos claramente separados para colocar comida y ropa separadas,1,17
"nikon55-200: yes this nikon lens is all that i expected it to be, very good product for the beginner and novice user. i would recommend that a new user purchase this lens to start his/her photogarphy experience.",1,37
"comprehensiveand factual: i'm a huge doors fan, particularly jim morrson. i've read a lot of different accounts of his life and this was a really good summation of all my reading. i thought the format was interesting. good film.",1,39
"plenty of goodies at a good deal: good deal for some decent condoms, and the rings are a steal, well worth the price when those are included. the tin they come in is a nice bonus too. there are better deals for condoms but these came from amazon themself and were shipped fast, and you know what you are getting, so it was well worth it.",1,66
worked good: i purchased these for my aunt who was recently released from a rehabilitation center after back surgery and from what i understand they are working great...........i did not use them personally.,1,33
"great product: i love it, it a bit small, love the orange color inside too. too bad not enought inside pockets. just enought for a laptop and a small file. if you looking for something that can hold large file, this is not the right now.",1,46
"great free romance read: i got this book because it free but liked it so much i bought the sequel ""a compromised lady"". the heroine was strong but not bratty as they sometimes are. the hero, although he did one really stupid thing, was brooding and tender, just what you want in an alpha. i'm looking forward to reading the sequel about his twin richard.",1,65
"softer, more well-rounded version of the excellent original!: i found the original version of firebird in a used bookstore over a decade ago. i have to confess, i initially bought it because i liked the cover! but then something strange happened when i tried to read it -- i couldn't put the book down. i was so caught up in the tale of firebird and brennen that i read it from cover to cover in almost 1 sitting.i was not disappointed with the new version. all of the characters that i liked so much were intact, and given extra dimensions to their personalities. i plan to read fusion fire (the sequel) as soon as possible.",1,115
"for those trying to understand and grasp the complicated: that moment when your doctor tells you that you have a condition no one you know has ever heard of, it has no cure, and will likely only continue to get worse. but you have the name of the evil monster under your bed, keeping you up at night and haunting you all day. with that name buy this book, buy several, give them to your family and close friends. it is hard for you and impossible for them to go through this but understanding it will make things so much easier",1,101
"very good quality: i needed this device, very practical, with a good balance and very good quality. i think it was a very good purchase",1,25
"good price - good headset: talking on the phone all day giving you cell ear? give this headset a try, at the price it's a good deal. i paid almost full price for mine, and used it constantly until it broke. the replacement one i got cheap so i wasn't too unhappy. it's small, so watch where you put it. mine ended up under foot. one crunch and it was a goner. my fault not motorolas.",1,76
beautiful sound!: purchased pickup to upgrade my son's fender acoustic before he leaves for college. the product arrived on time and was packaged appropriately. supplied installation instructions were complete and readily understandable (must read through a couple of times before starting). the upgrade turned out great and my son is extremely pleased with the true crisp sound.,1,57
"hot and steamy.: beautifully written with surprising plot twists. the sex scenes are always hot and inspired. waller seems to know a thing or two about adultery, and writes eloquently about it. my only complaint is waller's typical need to describe all of his foreign travels and political/personal causes in each and every novel.",1,54
"awesome cd.: this cd was easily one of the best releases last year so i had to post a review. from beginning to end every song is catchy yet in your face and thats the best way to do it. the lyrics are insane, guitar work is insane, drums insane. the riff in stab.stab.stab will not leave your head believe me.100/5 stars",1,62
"more than just a survivor: mira lived to tell the tale of the holocaust. she's carried the message of strength and forgiveness, of working through the horrors she's lived by bringing the message to all who will listen. this is a strange and different book: on the one hand, so repulsive, so unbelievable, yet, on the other hand, compelling. several questions ran through my mind: how does a person continue to live with any humanity at all after such an experience; why does one person live, while all the rest die; what kind of magnetism did mira have that encouraged people to help her?i've met mira; she lives here in my home town of oak ridge. she will speak before my class. perhaps my questons will be answered, and i will know who mira is after all.",1,137
"it really works: i bought the air revitalizer because i have dogs and a cat and i didn't want my house to smell like i have dogs and cats! when i bought it, i lived in a one story house. it worked great. (the only scent i've used is vanilla.) i don't think the sound is too loud, but i lived in a large house. when my house was for sale, i used it everyday and the house had a nice scent. i moved to a two story house, and didn't think it would scent as much of the house. i placed it in my entryway near the stairs and it scents most of the downstairs and upstairs from that location. i am impressed and very glad that i have it.",1,131
"arresting: although norah jones is young, she is an extremely talented artist. i received my first norah jones cd as a mother's day present--what a wonderful gift!!! her music is absolutely arresting--i was captivated before the cd even finished! i now own all her cds.",1,45
family fun: in this slow economy my husband have stated having game nights...this game has been a welcome addition to our table...the little pawns shaped like animals are so cute,1,30
"cat scratch fever: i have two cats and they love this multi-function toy. they bat the ball back and forth between the two of them. add a little catnip and watch them go crazy. if the pad wears out, flip it over to extend the life. remember prices can change at any given time making it more or less reasonable. furniture approved. highly recommend.",1,64
as advertised: this under-rug padding was delivered in good condition and is of good quality. i recommend this product.,1,19
"good ol' fashion pampers.: i bought these specifically because i missed using pampers after they introduced the dry max technology into their cruisers. i thought i would try the baby dry on my son since it says nothing about dry max on the box. it also says overnight on the package, so i thought it would be a little more absorbent. i have been very satisfied with this diaper and do expect to buy more after this huge box is gone.",1,81
"durable stainless clothing rack: i received my new clothing rack and i love it. it is durable, stainless, and great looking!i can clean it easily, and it will go with me when i move to another location.it stores well,and holds a lot of clothing.this is the best rack i have ever used and wouldbuy another one if i need more drying space.i love the price and feel i got a great deal.linda, wa state",1,74
"casio dw290-1v: i am quite pleased with this watch. i wanted a g-shock, but this is as close as one could get and loving it!",1,25
"a dog's dream come true!: i have two small chihuahua mix dogs and they absolutely love this bed warmer. it actually keeps them in bed and calm through the night and during stressful times when i am gone. it is warm to the touch and really heats up the bed when you use it. i would recommend using it with a bed with a liner you can unzip so you can put the warmer inside. this way, the whole bed gets cozy and your dog will stay warm and comfortable.the amazon price is great as my local pet stores are selling these for close to $50.",1,106
"the best tribute album out there!: when i first heard this album was coming out, i thought, oh no not another lane tribute album, but then i heard d'yer ma'ker, and hey what can i do, and i thought there were fabalously remade. the version ""thank you"" by duran duran, sold this album. i thought that was so close to the real thing--i thought this album rocked and everyone should consider buying it.",1,73
"glenn miller story: this movie has been a favorite of mine for many years. i was raised on the big band music and i never regretted being able to identify glenn miller, tommy dorsey, frank sinatra music while the other kids my age were listening to more modern music. and now that my son is in the air force, this movie has become a special one to him too.",1,69
"bush bashing.: mr. moore writes about the issues with the bush family and the ethics of the us government towards the world before and after 9/11. most of his points are backed up with research; some points seemed bias especially concerning corporations and the government. i do agree with most of his points although would recommend readers to do their own research beforehand. i thought this book deserved 4-stars, since mr. moore kept pushing the same point towards the bush family and thought he should have expanded more on the other government officials he mentioned in the book.on a side note, i just saw his movie ""roger & me"", which depicts the flint city falling apart due to gm leaving the city; this movie also shows how mr. moore started his journey. it is good for the american society to see a different point of view from the ones we see on public tv and some newspapers. looking forward to watch his newest movie ""fahrenheit 911"". keep up the work.",1,170
5 stars!!!!!!!: this is thee love story movie. nothing and nobody has done it for me other than omar epps and sanaa lathan. i know this movie backwards and forwards. a must have in your movie collection!,1,37
"well written, informative, humorous and thought provoking.: ""a question of balance"" is an owners handbook for the human body. we all make choices every day and those choices good or bad are what will determine if we go towards health or disease. if you think balance and not cures you will lead a happy and healthy life. i look forward to dr. dicenso's next book.",1,65
"well sung mozart at 12: this is a libretto by an experienced writer of comic opera with a score by a uniquely talented 12 year old. let us not compare it with what what the mature mozart could do with the stimulus of an outstanding writer like daponte.still as a traditional romantic farce, when well sung, it can be quite enjoyable. this production is typical of the mozart 22 set, updating and revising words and music to fit the conception of the production staff. i did not object to the intent but found that it did not work in performance. no fault of the singer/actors; they made the most of what they were given vocally; what they were given to act, was however, to me, often written and staged to be a singular distraction from the operatic core.clearly, viewers differ as to that judgment. if one is selecting but one dvd to buy, the reader will have to make his/her own predilections in making a choice. happily more than one approach is available.",1,173
"solid and stylish, just what i need: functional with steel toe i need for job, quick slip in, and yet stylish for daily wear.",1,24
"at least eight stars!: stewart o'nan never fails to impress me. he tackles different themes, different eras, different everything in each book. this one, slim and incisive, is a masterpiece of understatement. the tale of jacob hansen's life and losses soon after the civil war, when the town of friendship is stricken by both a diphtheria epidemic and a raging forest fire, is exquisitely simple but remarkably powerful. i haven't stopped thinking about this book since i finished reading it. i marvel at how much o'nan manages to convey without ever being explicit. love, tragic loss, and survival against all odds are the interwoven strands of the theme. life lessons compressed into one short book. this is a very special novel, written by a wonderfully gifted writer.",1,127
"decent: i've had this for about a year and it's held up for that long so i guess it's decent. never had any problems with it but it isn't anything special. it doesn't work well on really thick hair, thatis my only problem with it.",1,45
lion of the desert: all of linda's books are well written. i was fascinated by her descriptions of world war i and the strength of her characters who lived it. this story kept me interested from beginning to end.,1,39
"fine brewing, some drawbacks: five stars for good coffee. we're very pleased with the coffee-brewing -- the taste is excellent and consistent.three stars for some product design elements. the carafe's design is disappointing. although it does not drip, the configuration is annoying: the handle is open at the botton (not a good idea if one wants to clean it in a dishwasher); the rim collects water inside and outside so that hand-washing necessitates hand drying. also, as mentioned in other reviews, the water-level gauge on the side of the unit is quite narrow and difficult to see (we drew a mark with on the level that we use most).",1,109
"best self-help book ever written on dysfunctional ""loving."": read 'em all - women who love too much, men who hate women & the women who love them, love addictions, etc. - but bryn collins' book is the end-all, be-all for identifying, avoiding, and healing from emotionally devastating ""relationships."" without distracting psychobabble, collins nails emotional unavailability, in all its forms, precisely on the head. book contains clear examples, explanations, instructions - and practical (and do-able) solutions, with bombeck-like wit and insights. emotional unavailability is the advice your mother and all your friends would have given you, if only they'd been blessed with bryn collins' ability to spark understanding and activate your light bulb. best book ever for emotionally-starved lovers past and present, this book should be required reading for entering into an intimate relationship.",1,133
"had to have, was a classic from my childhood: didn't think i could find it online when i bought this, but this company came through for me and for that i am greatful. 5 stars",1,35
"erratic problems after 1 year: a great unit for the price. after 1 year and 2 months, however, the backlight on the keypad is on the fritz. the backlight is flickering on and off continuously which will surely drain the battery quickly. the unit still works though. i'll update my review with how chamberlain will deal with the issue (i can't find anywhere what the warranty period is but it will probably be 1 year!edit: i called chamberlain directly and they were very nice and offered to send me a free replacement unit even though i was just 2 months outside of the 1 year warranty period. i've upped my rating from 3 to 4 stars based on their customer service.",1,121
"great: everything about command hooks is awesome. they do a consistently good job, and i have bought just about one of every one of their line of products. these hooks are great for holding up your broom or other larger items in a closet or storage area. because they are kind of ugly plastic, i wouldn't put them in a public area, but then that is not what they are for, so they still get a 5 star review.",1,79
"where to get book: i got the book by calling 954 597 9922. the book was a great help in understanding the deliberate lies of the nation of hate otherwise called the nation of islam. trager destroys their arguments and shows the true authors of the slave trade, the nation of islam's fellow muslims. of course, farrakhan and company deliberately ignore that fact.",1,63
"if you love r&b this cd is perfect: this is a cd where you can just let it play through all the songs and love every minute of it, his voice is smooth and soothing... a must have cd!",1,39
bouncy creme: i have used bouncy creme for years now. it is a wonderful product if you want to gain control of your hair. helps with shine and volume. i absolutely love this stuff and was happy to find it on amazon!,1,42
"ashamed to admit, i couldn't put this down: i read this in less than 24 hours - started at 8 pm one night, and finished at noon the next day (and did get some sleep, bathe some kids, do some grocery shopping,etc. in between!) so...it's not a taxing read (great literature) by any means, but i'm embarrassed by how much i enjoyed it. unlike others, i do find the chemistry totally believeable between the main characters - and i liked the story very much. i'm a mystery lover, so i will admit the mystery is a bit weak - however the rest of the story is a terrific read.",1,109
"dangerous liasions: beautiful, elegant, seductive and entertaining film version of the translated, same titled play. also adapted for the screen in a film called ""valmont"" starring colin firth and fairuza balk, this film is extremely good. it's photography and direction is truly astonishing, as well as the classical music pieces. glenn close, john malkovich and michelle pheifer grace the movie with their excellent performances, as well as uma thurman and keanu reeves in suprisingly one of their lesser known roles. a scrumptious film about the battle of the sexes.",1,89
"my dream of heaven: i felt it was more well written in consistancy than ""within heavens gates -held my attention to detail more.",1,23
great plot and character development: i enjoyed this book as it drew me in from the first page. i was a little confused towards the end of the story because it went off on a different vein than what i expected but it ended up evening out and it finally made sense. the intricate storyline kept me turning the page and i read this book in 2 days.i would recommend this book to people who are into thrillers.i give this book 5 stars for the clear plot-line and interesting character development.,1,91
"great netgear router: this works great and excellent performance. one small issue, it does not pick up the dynamic ip changes some times.",1,23
"great end to the trilogy: while i still think the second movie is the best, this is a nice ending to the best batman movie series so far (in my opinion). christopher nolan did a wonderful job of re-introducing this classic character and world).",1,44
best brush for dogs with undercoats: this brush is perfect for dogs with undercoats. (my dog is part husky.) you don't have to use a lot of muscle either to get all the undercoat and dead hair off. this has an ergonomic grip and a sturdy metal frame. i bought an imitation version of this tool years ago. same shedding edge but a plastic handle. that plastic handle broke on the second use.you can feel that the furminator is solid and substantial.,1,82
"feel good rock tunes: when i originally bought this cd back in 95, i found myself just playing the hits (wonderwall, don't look back in anger, morning glory, and champagne supernova), and skiping over the songs i didn't know. maybe i just didn't have much time, and decided to only listen to the songs i knew i liked. i really don't remember.but i finally gave this cd a real listen a few months ago, and damn, it is good. this is sing-a-long, feel good rock and roll, with an old time british rock sound....but harder. ""hello"" is great way to open the cd, and i love the way ""some might say"" begins. great guitars! my favorite songs on the album are probably ""some might say"" and ""morning glory"", but i pretty much think whatever song i'm listening to at the time is my favorite! i could probably do without ""cast no shadow"" and ""she's electric"", but overall, this is a solid cd.",1,162
"learn many things: although i already knew most of the things they told me in this book, i still picked up a lot. the author of this book did a great job picking up clues and running bits along with small details j.k. herself put in that are so small, i doubt anyone would have picked them up the first few times reading them.",1,64
"awesome sound, but no a/c adapter.: i love this little speaker. compared to the little one my son bought at radio shack, it has unbelievable sound quality. however, i paid only $17 on a gold box deal, so i am taking that into consideration. i would never pay retail, altho' some of you might think it is worth it to get this kind of bass. it is completely portable which makes my ipod so much more useable both in the car & at home. the only thing i am unhappy with is that no a/c adaptor is included. however, my husband said a/c adaptors are easy to get, so once i have that, you won't hear one more complaint from me.",1,121
blocks: i bought this for my grandson. my daughter had one similar when she was a baby & was very helpful in her shape recognition. i'm sure when my grandson is alittle older he too will have fun with it instead of just a chew toy.,1,46
good product: easy to use. i ordered the 12 inch tongs as well since i liked the 9 inch so much. both are good purchases.,1,25
"gut wrenching story: this is a very large book filled with numerous stories about a terrible battle in wwi. the sories in this book just make you feel as you were there. at times i felt as if i knew the soldiers and i thought at times i did not want to turn the page becuase i was sure the person i was reading about would be killed on the next page. but i turned the page, some lived through the day others did not. you can feel the loss. this is a very powerful story that is well told.",1,100
"excellent beginner's guide!: i purchased this book, popped in the cd and had linux set up on a partition within hours. the first half of this book covers installation, the rest covers file system, commands, and setting up hardware for internet, networking, etc. excellent part of tens, covers compatible hardware, support/online groups and linux conventions. good book for starting linux. includes netscape communicator 4.07, red hat linux 5.2 and x window system, also known as x. this book will get you started, but there is more to learn.",1,88
gwar live from my. fuji: awesome! gwar is getting better as they get older. this rocks as well as the earlier violence has arrived and war party. gwar will live forever!,1,31
"color is different: i bought the brown guitar strap. what was delivered was much darker than what is shown in here. i wanted a lighter one just as shown. anyway, this strap is good. cannot return the item as i am outside the us.",1,44
heartbreaker: exciting and fast paced. i must admit i had identified the wrong villan. the plot is amusing in places when nick's emotions for laurent become so conflicted. a good read.,1,31
"satisfied customer: purchased this folding camp stool primarily for use with my outdoor close-up/macrophotography pursuits, involving use of a tripod to set up close-up shots. works out great for that. the unit is lightwieght, sturdy and portable. the attached strap, although not adjustable, is more than adequate for comfortable, ""over the shoulder"" carrying and the stool collapses easily, for space saving storage. highly recommend.",1,64
"great book for hat knitters: i liked this book because it contained both simple and harder patterns. the simple ones are really good for beginning knitters. although i have only made two of the designs in this book, i plan to make the other patterns as gifts.",1,47
"great value: this is a very good juicer that is the best value for money you will find. the motor is incredibly strong and doesn't blink an eye at beets, apples, whatever. cleanup is easy too. you just have to make sure and put enough fruit/veg through the machine at once or it tends to dribble down the side of the machine after coming out of the spout. but not a major problem.",1,73
great support: the bra gives amazing support for a really full figure. like everything else made for a full figure it is not pretty. the price online was half what i paid retail for the first one i got!,1,39
"this book suprised me: after reading all the reviews here on amazon i decided to give this book a chance. i'm so glad i did because this book is an absolute gem. i know some people will be turned off by the magic used through the summoning of demons, but its light hearted and if anything the humans are far worse than the spirits they summon. that's one of the things i loved so much about the book was how no one was perfect. most of the people in the book including the boy are selfish, cruel and arrogant, it's hilarious reading bartimaeus's notes on his many observations of human behavior that oh so true. so if you're looking for a fresh and original book with a great story, and characters i highly recommend this book.",1,136
"good oven...not so hot toaster: works fine so far as a small oven, but the ""toast"" feature is unsatisfactory. tried adjusting the settings & where the bread is placed per the instructions but toast still ends up with scorched sections.",1,40
someone like you: this book is so great. it deals with so many trials of teen life. it shows teens how fast everything can change and how one little mistake can change everything. very well written and engaging.,1,38
amazing..great book: this is the one to read. i even gave it to my husband to read. easy to read. i read it in 2 hours. this book gave me the reasons people act the way they do. then it gave me a way to talk to those kinds of people.,1,51
"my son loves it: this seat was perfect for what we needed. it's nice and light, so easy to move around if we need to. my 3 year old son is a fan of little einsteins and i guess because it's red he calls it his ""rocket seat"" and seems to really like it. i was a little nervous about him only being restrained by the seat belt (and when he had it in on of our cars, he was able to reach the seat belt button and escape-which was a little scary) but in the main car we use it in, he can't reach the button and it seems to do the trick.",1,114
love it!: absolutely love it! it was not hard to program and it even works with our projector. i am so glad to have one remote and not five :-),1,30
very efficient: the product is very light weight and easy to manage. blade cuts well and is easy to manuver.,1,20
awe inspiring!: bruce's description of how a single cell's intelligence is mimicked by multi cell communities (i.e humans) takes the reader on a journey toward their own ability to change the fate he/she believes awaited them from the start. kudos to bruce for keeping at these new discoveries about how humans can thrive and essentially evolve into the next generation.,1,60
"a pre-human condition of savagery & cannibalism: here's a story of one messed up family, afflicted by a genetic condition that gradually deteriorates the mind and reverts the afflicted to a savage state, behold the merrye syndrome. ""the unfortunate result of inbreeding.""now this movie isn't exactly gore driven, it's more of an eerie creeper that implies alot with out actually showing. which might anger some of the sadists out there. but it works pretty darn well. the cast is really good, especially sid haig. this movie is an obvious precursor to the texas chainsaw massacre which should make people want to see it. besides it has lon chaney jr. in it. what horror fan wouldn't want to see spider baby?great dialogue, uber-creepines, and one sicko story, not much more to ask for in a horror film.""just because something isn't good doesn't mean it's bad.""""eating of flesh would hasten the progress of their condition.""""help me find something sharp.""",1,157
"great characters: i, too, suffer from ocd and i could relate so well to her rituals and phobias. perhaps she seems unbelievable to those who have never suffered from or encountered another person who suffers from ocd, but the behavior is just as odd as griffin portrays it.",1,48
"why is amazon asking if this is the game? hmm: well, for under $10, composite sounds nice, and it seems nice..(since once you have hdtv, you want everything hd)but is it just me or when the screen is blank, it shows lots of noise on tv..when game screen's on, overall, i'm satisfied, but either when it's loading or pre-game screen, it shows lots of 'dust-looking' noise on tv.other than that..it's all good.",1,72
"great guide: great guide to central idaho - useful even for people that live here. my husband and i live in idaho (and have for years). we have used this book on two different vacations. especially if you like to explore back roads and alternate routes, this is a great book to have around. we even found new places to explore in areas i have been exploring for 20 years. have fun.",1,72
beautiful: this album was beautifel...and is wonderful compared to her days with swv......she has came along way and this album is very very overlooked and overrated..anybody who doesn't appreciate it is sick in thier heads...from beginning to end she shines and she needs to make a sophmore effort...on a roll and one of the best albums ive ever heard,1,59

"a classic: almost 30 years since this book was first introduced. back then it was a shining light in the darkness when trying to figure out the value and details regarding the beatles us records. gaining knowledge was more difficult back then, with no internet, no ebay, and little consensus on what was what in the beatles collecting world. perry cox and joe lindsay gave us a path to enlightenment, and although some of this book's info and its presentation now looks ancient, it was the first step of a stairway that has been climbed by other authors and fans who owe a debt of gratitude to this pioneering work. now this book is a collectible on its own, regardless of its usefulness, it is history. i'll always cherish my copy.",1,131

"wouldn't do without.: after doing my homework on this product, i feel it is worth the money. i have been dealing with thinning scalp areas and thought this would help. i have purchase this twice now and have notice my hair is filling in well. only use once a week after washing my hair and i focus on my edges and the spot that is prone to thinning. it lasts me about a year so the price works.",1,78
it's gonna burn: this was the best workout i've ever had it really makes you want to get up and move. and it dosent hurt that the people that you are watching and working out with are also over weight and struggling just as hard as you are. i recommend this workout to anyone that wants to get into shape.,1,60
i recommend this product... even now that has other new product with more options from pinnacle: it's very good product.need much ram in the pc to use the software (pinnacle studio) but it's easy to use and good to carry with you to other places...i got some problems with ntsc/pal m using vcr video record but got solved with updating pinnacle studio. not 100% now but is working.,1,68
"my favorite headphones!: i've been using these headphones for years! as with all headphones, the wires are subject to breakage when pulled, so i keep an extra pair or two available. they last for 2-3 months of fairly heavy usage. i listen to audiobooks and music while i'm ironing, cooking, knitting and walking. i started using this brand and style of headphones when the children were infants because the earpieces do not block sound. they just sit comfortably in the outer part of my ear. i've tried earpieces that came with my mp3 player, but i can't tolerate the irritation from having them in my ears. heavier headphones flatten my hair and block sound. these are definitely my favorite headphones!",1,120
"can one really be that good?: probably yes, but it made me feel miles off!the format of the book, with different colours print to differentiate between the narrator and marjorie hinckley's words made it easy to read. it was uplifitng and interesting. the topical lay-out worked well. such a cute lady!personally, i found it slightly distancing that pearce wrote about herself in the 3rd person. 1st person would have personalised the content more but that's a minor point.",1,78
quality!: i am very pleased with this purchase. the leather is supple and extremely attractive. the pages are not so thin as to let the print show through on the opposite side. words of christ are in red.,1,38
"great product: this rootbeer kit is great. it is easy and fun to use. if your rootbeer is flat, you probably didn't let it sit in a warm, dark place long enough. it also tastes a lot better if you refrigerate it overnight before drinking it. hope this helps.",1,49
nice product: i have not personally used this coffee maker because it was a present to my brother. but he seems to really like it. he said it was simple to use and that it had a lot of really nice features (like the automatic off function).,1,47
"a movie worth watching!: walk the line sheds light on the life of the well-known singer johnny cash.it is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.joaquin phoenix and reese witherspoon have outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.the only major setback is in relation to ginnifer goodwin who is not that great as vivian cash.the setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!in short, it is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!",1,99
good cuppa: good quality and nice looking but only keeps coffee warm for a short time. does drip if the lid is not exactly positioned correctly but other than that very happy with the press pot.,1,36
love this book!!: amazing book! i've read this to my children and give this book as gifts! it's a wonderful gift to give!!,1,23
easy to use calculator: this is easy to use and works good. the platic cover for the keys broke off. it was only attached with a couple of plastic pins.,1,30
"delightful story with wonderful ensemble of actors: this story of a poor british girl with limited means and a big imagination is one of my favorite movies, and always leaves a smile on my face (and maybe a few tears in my eyes, too.). the cast is absolutely dreamy, including jim broadbent, stephen rea, john lithgow, the hilarious kevin kline, and the beautiful phoebe cates as the ""princess"". anyone who loves ""period"" pieces will love this film. (it is now being shown on the ""romance"" cable tv channel, too.)",1,89
"tuck everlasting: i enjoyed the book because it made me think that life is to short . i personally would not like living forever because you would never grow old and never die and go to heaven, but you see the world change,and could do dangerous stunts and not have a bruise or anything.at first i thought it was going to be boring, but i wanted to keep reading farther than i was assigned! i'd give the book 4and a half stars.s.m.s, 6th grade",1,84
"awesome, but take with a fill stomach: i have had severe bladder infections since i was a child, and i remember back in the day when you could only get this stuff with a prescription! it works absolute wonders with the pain of a uti. it can make your urine slightly orange (it's supposed to, that's how the drug gets to your bladder). however, word of caution: unless i take this with food, i get extremely nauseous from it. i'm usually not affected by medications, but for some reason this drug really doesn't sit well with an empty stomach.",1,99
"somewhat detailed history of longacres race track: a little too much attention given to the personalities behind longacres -- not enough to the racing history, horses, trainers and jockeys.more attention should have been given to the actual background/details behind the decision to sell the land to boeing and why the family did not give sufficient time and notice in advance to racing interests who might have wanted/been able to purchase the land/track thereby enabling racing to continue uninterrupted in western washingtion, without forcing racing to laspe for several years before the construction of the much less attractive/less inviting emerald downs in nondescript auburn wa",1,104
ahhhhhhhhh.......: the horrible ear buds that came with my pricey mp3 player not only gave me an earache but were a pain in the neck to keep in place. i could wear these little koss plugs all day long and never know they're there. and sound quality is perfect.,1,49
tom hanks knows how to pick a good movie: the road to perdition is awsome i went to a private screening of this movie it is his best acting scince the green mile it also is a very touching film about a hitman and his son i can't wait till it gets to theatres so i can see it with my dad perfect father son movie should have come out on father's day.,1,73

"works great with attbi in fort collins, co: the pain of getting it set up is well worth the price. after 4 phone calls to attbi's tech support, it works great! 3 of 4 tech support peeps kept telling me i needed to pay [the money] to have someone come out and install it. this is [nonsense]! finally one of the tech supporters knew what to do: simply register the cable modem at their online site...make sure you register your computer with your current modem, then register your 3com modem. if you don't reg your 3com modem at that site, you'll get slow speeds (~100k instead of 1.5m). like i said, the only trouble i had getting this modem set up was with attbi's tech support. once i found someone who know what they were talking about, it went smoothly. plus [buying] the modem sure beats [the] lease fee!! :)",1,150
"it's the best: it's been forty years and still no other work comes close. this is the standard. i would love to see someone do something that is as good, using arabic script instead of phonetics. in the meanwhile, this will continue to receive my highest recommendation.",1,47
"truly insightful: the reads more like a textbook but is full of criticism history alongside fresh thoughts from dr. jones. this is almost a must read for anyone who wishes to study the parables of jesus. he does, as what n.t. wright does, use the kingdom principle to tie everything together. the book is well written and clear enough for non-scholars but the thoughts are developed enough for seminary students. i highly recommend this book!",1,75
"fantastic: could not wait for the kindle to come to canada....was not disappointed...easy to read and no set up required...60 seconds and you have your book, newspaper or magazine ready to go...always with me when i travel....many more things kindle can do just havent got around to them yet....you have to get one...",1,53
"pretty good: overall, pretty good. i am a fan of the more folksy ig songs and think that ""let me go easy"" is one of their best as is the live version of ""gone again"" available only on itunes as far as i can tell. the remake of ""uncle johns band"" is also great as is the live version of elton john/bernie taupin's ""mona lisas and mad hatters."" the rest of the album is just so-so, and has some truly bad songs - i.e. ""shed your skin"" remix - but what album doesn't have a few duds. definately worth buying and ig fans won't be disappointed.",1,106
"kept me turning the pages....: it was interesting and empowering because it echoed what goes through women's minds. maybe we wouldn't have made the same choices that this woman did but it was refreshing to read a book where a woman made exotic choices, lived through them and became strengthened in the end.this book is a worthwhile read for those who are interested in seeing a woman lose herself in order to find herself.",1,74

"i love this sequel: i have a 3 year old daughter, whom is now into all the princess'. she watched little mermaid one time, and after the enchantment of the fins had her hooked to wanting to watch it every day. when little mermaid ii came on disney channel one night, it changed everything for her. she loves melody, ariel's daughter. no other disney princess movie represents a princess that has a mother. they are all passed on, or non existent. melody and ariel has a great relationship, like any young adolescence child and her mother would. i think this movie is a positive role model for children, and yet there is nothing to buy with melody represented, which is a shame.",1,122

"assembly is tricky -but great buy: the other write-up is correct - the directions are not the greatest, but i was able to put it together myself. i did have to have my husband tighten everything and put in the last 2 screws, but it was a good buy for the price, and now the golf bags have a place!",1,60
"calamity goes to the cotswolds: crawl into the cozy of the cotswalds with agatha raisin, who makes her debut as unorthodox heroine to the menopausal set. taking a well earned early retirement to the village of carsley, agatha tries to adapt her presumptuous and pushy personality to the cozy and contentious community life. aggressive agatha is clueless in the deportment department, but determined to fit into her imagined idyllic retirement at any cost. and never imagines that the store bought quiche she enters into the village cooking contest will kill someone. agatha's allure lies in her complete lack of tact and charm, her assertive aplomb, shrewd intellect, rude responses, and the little glimpses the reader is permitted of the human agatha. the scenery is splendidly sketched, the cast of characters outrageous but somehow believable, and this middle aged mama's only complaint is that this book ends all too quickly - but hold on - this is a series, and more agatha awaits.",1,162
"a gold medal cd: the donnas new cd 'gold medal' is worth just that. all of the songs sound great with hard, catchy riffs. the cd has a 70'sfeel to it, whereas 'spend the night' had an ac/dc feel to it.if you like hard 70's rnr, buy this cd.",1,49
"great,great,great: i have been listening to this cd for the last several months, and the more i listen to it the more impressed i am. this is a great,great,great cd. this is one of those cd's that you want to listen to every song on, where every song is incredible and quite unique, quite a diversity of style. i am very impressed - certainly one of the better recent cd's i own - ranks up there with forty foot echo, hoobastank, and a few others. definitely worth buying. hope to hear more from them.",1,94
"sounds really good: i read through amazon's reviews and on other sites and most people liked these speakers and they are higher quality than the bottom line type. they have a long warranty which says something about the quality - imo. i'm using as stereo speakers with a 2 channel onkyo receiver and an onkyo cd player and also for tv and dvds. for small speakers the sound is very good. they have a very wide frequency range and i compared with more expensive speakers and these had the same type of specs. i don't know if that actually means anything but it is a way to gauge. i used on the floor and now they are perched on 30"" stands. either way sound good but i prefer the stands.bottom line is if you are looking for an upgraded smaller speaker and don't want to spend a fortune these are the way to go.",1,154
"masada bath salts, relaxing lavender: i love the fragrance and how it does soften the water. i have fibromyalgia so hot soaks in tub are a neccesity and lavendar is a very soft relaxing scent that calms and helps with sleep. i highly recommend this product.",1,46
captian underpants and the attack of the talking toilets: i admit that the title is a little off putting but any book that can get reluctant readers to pick it up gets a a+ in my book. not a great work of literature obviously but kids love it and it gets them reading. that is the important thing!,1,58

"slow start, but still a great book in the series: this is the 4th book in flynn's series. if you can, you'll really want to read them in order. this one took quite a while to get going. the first 80 pages were little else but recapping the prior three books. i think some recap is fine, but this was way too much. from there, i thought it still had trouble getting traction. finally, about the last 1/3 of the book took off and kept me page turning.i love the serial aspect of these novels, they flow nicely from one book to the next. i also like flynn's mixture of actual history with his fictional world.so, far of the 4 books, the 1st and 2nd have been the best for action, the 3rd and 4th were much more focused on washington dc rather than ""front line"" action.appropriateness: this book contains a fair amount of language... a word or two every 10 pages. there are characters that are hurt and killed, but none are described graphically. sexual situations are eluded to, but are not in this book.",1,186
"difficult to read.. but well written.: this by far has to be one of the most difficult books ive attempted to read, and i to no extent mean the words more so the topics touched in this story. the only thing pushing me to finish it is hope that some sort of justice is served in the plot. the fact that a 40 year old deprives a 12 year old girl of her innocence will at most times in the book leave you in disgust and feeling disturbed. but credit be given where its due, the author is a genius and some would say a madman himself to be able to tell this story of a mad man. i do admire that with the touchy subjects that he wrote on he never used any sort of vulgar vocabulary to describe certain scenes. in my opinion its a mentally strenuous book to jump into because of the monster who is telling his story but the author hit it dead on, minus some parts which i think get very repetitive. take what you can from this story, which is hard to with a closed mind, and then move on.",1,197
"great alternative: great features, great quality product for the money. dislike the lack of attachments or other options, compared to the kitchen aid model but it does everything i need it for.",1,32
"did all 4 doors,,,,doing the floor next!: overall the product was fairly easy to install...cut and paste! i just got done installing the dynamat extreme on all four doors and the whole trunk of my 2000 impala and it made a big difference. the car was noticeably quieter and the doors felt a lot more solid. cant wait to do the floor next.",1,63

"feelin' retro: i am glad to have finally added the digital version of this to my collection. i had the original vinyl back in the day and i loved it's quirky subject matter and classic 80s synth pop sound. ned liben (ebn) was the composer who sculpted the synth sound. i believe that he went on to work with scritti politti and, sadly, died in 1998 of a heart attack. i was a member of the kurzweil k2000 user group back then and one of the other members was close to him and his wife. he said that they had mastered a digital version of the album for release and it was just a matter of time before it became available. well, i am glad to finally own it.the only reason that i didn't give this a 5-star rating is because i really wish that it included the remixes of ""bag lady"" and ""aeiou and sometimes y.""enjoy and relive the memories...",1,161
"good overview over different neurological conditions: i liked the differentiated explanations of conditions that are much more prevalent in children today. for me it was a stepping stone to another book written by kenneth bock, md.healing the new childhood epidemics: autism, adhd, asthma, and allergies: the groundbreaking program for the 4-a disorders",1,52
"great pad: i don't understand the people who diss this pad because it's louder than others. i think that's a real advantage. the conventional pads are way too quiet. you can't really play dynamics.it's true that your roommates won't like this one, but they shouldn't have agreed to room with a drummer. drums are loud!this is a really good pad.",1,60
"good book but not his best.: this was the fourth book i read by nelson demille and this all in a 6 months frame. i fell in love with nelson demille as an author when i read his novel plum island in june. since then, i read the general's daughter as well as word of honor and both kept me reading until the wee hours of the morning. when i got to spenceville, i was captivated with it at the beginning, but as the story went on, i found myself somewhat bored with the all too ""predictable"" plot. it was still a cute story but a little too ""feel-good"" ending for me. the characters are easy to identify with but it is hard to create any real ""attachement"" to them because of their ""whishy-washyness"". this is not to mean that i hated the book and do not recommend it to anyone but simply that if you too are a demille fan, you may not want to keep this one for last. it is really light and an easy read.",1,179
batteries are awesome: these things are great. got them for my wii. they were dead when i got them but a few hours in the charger (not included) got them right up. would buy from again.,1,36
"a must buy for any priest fan: the sound and picture are excellent on this dvd considering when it was shot ""1982"". this dvd shows a young judas priest. you will notice all the guitarists running around stage alot more then they did on rising in the east. you will also notice that rob halford hits his notes higher and longer. the introduction starts with electric eye just like they did on rising in the east, on this dvd though the song sounds more like the studio version. some of my favorites are on this one too such as devil's child, screaming for vengence, the green manalishi (with the two pronged crown), and sinner was amazing. like i titled this, it is a must buy for any priest fan.",1,129
"reel and raw: people who are criticizing this for being raw, simplistic and poorly written do not understand what punk rock is and have been raised on the shopping mall version. this is real and cool, much like the ramones in their early days but from a bratty teen punk chick perspective. it's high school punk at it's best and the tracks that are recorded the worst(reminds me of the germs first 45, maybe recorded worse!!)are actually the most interesting.",1,80
"for true fans: i bought this bender head for $107 with my tax refund. best decision ever :p haha. it is a great bender head. the little antenna is in a little area right above it so if u keep it in the box you can't see it, but i recommend that you do keep it in the box so it can look like those heads with the water in them. plus its a cool box to keep. the dvd's do sometimes get stuck so i just decided to put them in a cd case holder and put the head on dislplay. the reason i gave it four instead of five stars was cause the dvd's get stuck and because sometimes its a little hard to open the bender head. it includes all the episodes and movies! i really love it.",1,141

"superbe. the best of its kind!: i was just able to watch this dvd and was very impressed. firstly, i wanted to comment on the production which is really a step forward in this genre of film. the editing is slick and clean. the audio is concice and well mastered.but what's important here is what the film covers. from a complete beginner, to someone with limited experience looking to improve the paddling experience, increase safety and basically have more fun, this video touches on all the little bits of information that are necessary, but that could take a lifetime to learn on ones own. if you're even just a weekend worrior, and paddle 2 or three times a year, this video is well worth watching for its wealth of information.",1,130
tailor made role for black! tough to dislike!: black is his usual over the top self in this very funny crowd pleaser. the supporting cast of kids and adults in the film are great. throw in some catchy rock tunes and a whole lot of zany situations and you've got one of the best comedies of the year. the original release on dvd has a very good transfer and some very cool extras including excellent commentaries which make for some interesting repeated viewings of the film.,1,86

it's all about christy!: hot body dvd's are decent - like a less well-produced playboy video. the good news is that they provide plenty of nudity and more often than not they have some very hot models. the perfect case in point is christy carrera. her tan-lined body is exquisite and there is more than enough time spent showcasing her. this is soft core porn at best. nothing explicit. but christy makes it all worthwhile.,1,75
"great but..: this is a great product! the wireless is great especially when just want to use the mouse on my leg when my arm hurts. i have noticed a problem with the mouse and games. the mouse tends to not work so greatg with the simsand a few other games in which it sometimes doesnt move, but if you just minimize the game and change channels it tends to work again. thats my only complaint with this product",1,79

"quite a nice read: for many years -- through two marriages and god knows how many moves -- i have kept a moldering issue of playboy for the simple reason that i didn't want to turn loose of one of my all-time favorite examples of the new journalism, ed mcclanahan's ""grateful dead i have known."" it's that good. that landmark piece and other tasty goodies have been collected into mcclanahan's my vita, with ed providing some new bridging material describing his growth as a writer. it's a pity he's not a more widely recognized writer. if you dig terry southern, charles portis, or hunter s. thompson, you'll like ed mcclanahan. if you're of that bent, i'd snatch up this book before it falls out of print.",1,126

"required reading for our founding team: i had been part of a couple of technology startups before i was lucky enough to have taken steve blank's class and read his book, and his customer development process is right on point. the process is the way to reduce the biggest risk outside of your startup's control: customer/market risk.it's a methodical, testable, measurable approach to what has historically been more of an art than a science: guessing what your customers want. more than that, it's accessible - the process is broken down into achievable chunks and can be adopted for almost any idea.this book is required reading for the founding team of our new startup, and every time we ""lose our way"" we go back to the hypotheses pegged to the wall. i can't recommend it highly enough.",1,136
"pretty good band, pretty good cd: wsc has a pretty good base here in dc. opening for groups at the 9:30 club and taking the stage at the black cat, they've continued to increase their exposure- which eventually led me to them. i was happy when they put out the cd, because while i tend to enjoy less well-known bands, i dont want them to remain obscure for my benefit.the group is pretty damn good. so's their cd. in addition to their music, they've got a pretty funny vibe, as they poke fun in their songs and at their concerts. i'd suggest you put up the money for the cd, even if you're just curious about them.oh, and the 5 stars is just cause they're from dc and i've seen them a ton of times. the cd is probably really a 4..",1,142
a definate must have: great album with tons of emotion and non of that pop garbage. i only wish their music was more available in the us because when they do break out here they will be a smash hit.,1,40
"sky dancers fly: i have two daughters ages 4 and 6, i have read the other reviews about strings breaking and such. we had our sky dancer now for a year. at first my youngest did have trouble pulling the string, but once my oldest daughter and i showed her how to pull, she did not have any trouble. camille flew wonderfully untill about a week ago when my cat developed a fetish for her wings. my suggestion to those parents thinking of buying one is this. my daughter is 4 and it took her a little while to understand how hard to pull this string. i don't recomend it for kids under 4. also if you do have a cat you might want to put the doll up at night. i have given a 4 star rating on education for both hand eye coordination and control. i will be buying two more for christmas this year. personally i think it's a great toy and a nice addition to a childs playthings.",1,172
"gary gygax is the master.: i have been roleplaying for years, many many years. i have seen games come and go, i have seen the white box set of g. gygax. i have seen games like runequest, warhammer frp, merp, torg, so many games.yet this is the real start, the real truth of how great roleplaying can be. you might find 3rd edition more intricate, more things to do in it, but the original ad&d players manual and dm manual were the best in my humble opinion.this book shows how to create characters quick and just start roaming the worlds that the dm makes. get it. and the dungeon master manual by g. gygax. you will love it better than almost anything else the roleplaying world has to offer.",1,129
one of the best ever!: this is a great game! i have a very large collection of games and love having friends over to play and this is always a favorite. i just wish that there was another refill pack available.,1,41
"omron hj-720itc review: i found in money magazine a review for the omron as the best pedometer on the market. i had never used one before so i gave it a try. i accidently left it in my pants pocket on the 2nd day i used it and it got washed, i was disappointed because it stop working but within 24 hours it dried out and was completely functional. i absolutely love this thing! i have bought 3 so far for family members and had a friend purchase one as well. it has truly motivated me to exercize more. the software that comes with it is great as well, it really helps you to keep track of your goals. the old saying is so true, ""if you can't measure it you can't manage it""!",1,134

"ruthless on religion - open on the reality: this book is an excellent take on the absurdity of religion and its power to render a dull, mind-numbing, irrational, and uninspiring view of the universe. even for an atheist and an aspiring physicist as me, the last chapter was truly interesting on the mystery of consciousness. the man is clear-thinking and smart as can be.",1,64
fond memories: i was thrilled to find a cd copy of the vinyl album i bought in about 1964! i had bought another rendition of these villa-lobos pieces but it just didn't do it for me. de los angeles has a wonderful soprano and the bachianas brasilleiras need a great voice.,1,51

"good product, but a rechargeable battery would have been nice: got this after having two waterpics - the large canister w/hose ac driven one, and the portable type. the canister unit finally leaked too badly to use any more, and the portable has loose heads that prevent you from controling the spray effectively. this unit works great and the heads are stable so you can aim at a specific area or tooth. the only downside is it's consumption of batteries. you can buy rechargeables but then you need to pack a charger when you travel. the irrigator breaks down to a nice compact unit for packing.",1,106
"charger works great: car charge is very quick and convenient. it charges super fast and is better than the one by creative labs because i don't need an adapter with this one. the draw back is that when it's charging and i have it playing through an aux cable in the car, the charger seems to add some white noise to the playback.",1,63
"great style and craftsmanship.: this watch looks very classy yet rugged, and it feels very solid. the face changes color depending on how the light hits it. it goes from a shiny bright blue (bright sunlight) to a deep rich blue (little light) to almost black (little light). setup is a little confusing but not too bad. i found a simplified version of the setup manual on citizen's web site. i suggest you do the same. i'm very happy with the purchase and the price on amazon was very good.",1,90
"this movie has everything: this movie is a suspense movie with some mild horror. the sixth sense is about a boy who sees dead people and gets help from a psychologist. when this movie came out, it was a surprise hit and was on the top 10 list of highest grossing american films of all time. recently, other movies have come on the list and sixth sense is no longer on it. however, even if someone sees this movie for the first time, i think they will be pleasantly surprised by how good it is.this movie has all the elements of a perfect movie: great character development, suspense, great acting, and an excellent story line.",1,115

jack aubrey at his best: captain aubrey raises his commodore's broad pennant for the first time. he finds commanding a single ship under his sole control less frustrating than dealing with the personalities of subordinant captains and commanders. the exotic locale and historical accuracy of this little known british adventure are well told in a fictionalized account inserting aubrey and maturin. a personal favorite.,1,64
"captures the imagination: posthumous speculation on what hendrix was going to release next. a great collection of mature late hendrix as he moved into a new period. heavy guitar solos like midnight, pali gap and peace in mississippi really beef up the vocal tracks. this album has been heavily criticized for tampering with the hendrix vision, but the song selection is better structured than the official release new rays. it also does justice to the tracks they just threw onto south saturn delta without any thought of album cohesion.",1,89

"best speaking translator i've seen: i recently purchased & returned other speaking translators (voice phrase books / talking dictionaries) from other companies (other brands). this franklin model is by far the best: clear, natural, speaking voice, vs. a computer-generated ""robot voice"", with others. my only criticism is that the speaking voice is too fast. at least it can be repeated as often as necessary.",1,64

"somewhat confusing but still worth while: although this is a grown up teen movie set for the 20 something college genera, it is still quite a good mystery flick. throughout the film the plot manages to twist and turn just enough to throw you completely off track in regards to your opinion on ""who done it?"". although the film does boast dominiqe swain as one of the title characters, don't expect her to be the lead, she does play a big part, but not as big as mia kirshner and meridith monroe.definately a film worth checking out if you like to have a surprise ending and like to act like shurlock holmes!",1,112

"excellent retrospective of a talented band: they may have been a one-hit-wonder, but what a hit! 96 tears is still a unique rock song, full of hypnotic atmosphere and clever musicianship more than 40 years after its release. the other material on the album is interesting and for the most part, equally well-played and quite enjoyable though less remarkable and less commercial than the band's one big hit. some songs are ballads, a few are quite bluesy, and others bristle with the unique sound that made 96 tears a song worth listening to for more than 40 years. with 27 tracks on the cd it's a good sampling of what this band had to offer. i waited for years for this music to become available on cd and purchased this disc without hesitation once i discovered it. don't sit ""down there, lookin up"", buy it now!",1,146
"better than her first!: sophomore novels rarely surpass that debut novel in quality, but notaro throws that assumption completely out of her way with this second collection of essays. it's even more enjoyable than her first book,the idiot girls' action-adventure club: true tales from a magnificent and clumsy life. be prepared to read it and laugh - some of the essays actually caused tears of laughter to roll down my face. it's a really fun read. yes, sedaris continues to reign as the master of the essay, but notaro's essays here are so much more enjoyable and a lot less grotesque than those in her first collection. i definitely plan on keeping an eye out for her other books!of all the essays in the book, though, ""the craft toothbrush"" particularly stands out. just thinking of it now still makes me laugh. there are many other wonderful essays in the collection, but that one is my personal favorite.",1,157

this is the best toy !: i raise lab puppies for canine companions...so i almost always have a lab puppy around.....this toy has never been destroyed ( little feet chewed off though) the squeaker has always remained intact. it is a perfect dog toy for land or water play. my current pup loves making it squeak so much so that my parrot can now imitate the squeak!,1,67
"sony ss-b1000 5.25"" speakers: great sound good price we're very happy to replace our old big speakers with smaller ones with as much or better sound!",1,26
"a great christmas album: i bought this cd a few years ago and have listened to it every season since, sometimes even after christmas is over. kathie lee has a terrific voice and it's a good song selection. i only wish she would do another christmas album with some of the songs she's done on her show, such as sleighride together with you.",1,63
"used as biotechnological narrative: in his article, ethnographic critique and technoscientific narratives: the old mole, ethical plateaux, and the governance of emergent biosocial polities, in culture, medicine and psychiatry (25: 355-93. 2001)michael m.j. fischer uses this book as a juxtaposition to ethnographic descriptions of bio-ethical realties. it's rather interesting and may possibly add some insight into the novel",1,58
to kill a mocking bird.....the best! by: sarah: i read this book my freshman year in high school. i thought it was excellent. it really makes us think about how racism still effects our world. it also teaches that you should treat everyone as an equal and to be kind. c'mon read it....you won't be dissappointed!,1,56
right on target yet someting missing: the book had been in the making at stanford for some time. i happened to use a manuscript of it in 1991 at virginia tech. i was pleasantly surprised how quickly a student could pick up relevant aspects of compuatational plasticity from this book; the book has a style of its own. we have successfully used the book in programming the integral (or endochronic) hardening rule with the incremental theory of plasticity. the book surely makes a useful companion to a plasticity textbook.it is disheartening to see that the numerical schemes for the integration of the constitutive equations of the endochronic theory are missing from the book.,1,113
"not her best: in my opinion, a so-so effort. well produced, but i don't think the material. or arrangements, are particulary well suited to diana's strengths.",1,26
"brash: i bought this album because i broke the first one (it was literally smashed during a move and in 3 pieces). i didn't hesitate to replace this album because it's so great. i hope i don't break this one but if i do, i'll replace it again.",1,48
for my son: this book has helped me help my son. i have learned a few tips along the way and it has been a fun experience going through this book with him,1,33
"delia's review: product is very good. the sound quality is outstanding, but occasionally there is light static. i would buy this product again. great product for the price.",1,28
loved it want more!: all of linda howard's mackenzie books are very good and keep you wanting more. does anyone know if she's going to do a book about chance. maris's story hinted at it. you won't want to put it down.,1,42
"excellent album...: this album is great. moon safari manages to appeal to many different emotional states of being for me, while maintaining a cool, fresh, ubiquitous aura of calmness. air melds several different musical ""styles"" extremely well together, such that, it's difficult to truly finger what really is the preeminent musical style on this album.every track has something unique and great to offer. most all listeners with an open mind will find this album laudable.highlights: ""kelly watch the stars,"" ""sexy boy,"" ""voyage de penelope""",1,84
good show: great series... something the kids and i like watching together. look forward to more episodes for the second half of season 2!,1,24
"from national music dept on: hats off to elder edgar petey madison and emmc for having some of the best in cogic music contributing to this effort--richard ""mr clean"" white, bettye nelson, kelvin lenox just to name a few.i like the song ""never give up"" with leroy burks and edgar o'neal too. the harmony on the lead reminded me of bro. o'neal and his late brother eddie. (the o'neal twins).",1,70
"underrated duo: sometimes, the best music of any genre isn't from the big names. this is one of those cases. i took a chance on koffee brown and bought this cd and let me say, i was plesantly surprised! ""mars/venus"" was one of the few cd's i can say that i can listen to and not skip at all!my favorites are ""weekend thing"" and ""after party"" but the whole cd is good. some tracks aren't age appropriate for kids though! while no where near as raunchy as many rap albums of today or r & b singers as r. kelly, adina howard or the legendary millie jackson, its probably best kept between you and your significant other.beyond that, i consider this one of the better pieces of r & b/hip hop out there! worth the price!",1,136
good quality: i bought this product to be able to charge my creative labs vision m mp3 player directly from ac instead of the vendor-supplied usb connection.i got great results. the product work great!,1,34
"excellent: rufus ditches all commerical considerations for this effort, and it makes for an exhilirating (if sometimes difficult listen).the dvd is a well-filmed live performance, though he comes across as rather catty in the off-stage footage. i'm not sure why a previous reviewer thinks wainwright's ""gay audience"" would prefer to see him in a towel, telling the camera to get lost. um, why?",1,63
"excellent book for introduction to project management: this book was really very helpful. i used it in order to prepare the necessary stuff for a 3 day seminar with title ""introduction to pm using pmbok"". it covers successfully the pmbok but using a different approach than the typical pmi's book. finally, i strongly believe that this book is one of the best educational books in the field of pm.dimitris tselios",1,70
"do not use a generic battery!: i want to point out that you should never buy a generic battery, like the person from san diego who reviewed the s410 on may 15, 2004, was recommending. yes you'd save money, but there have been many reports of generic batteries exploding when charged for too long. and don't think if your generic battery explodes you can sue somebody and win millions. these batteries are made in sweatshops in china, india and korea, and i doubt you can find anybody to sue. so play it safe, both for your own sake and the camera's sake. if you want a spare, get a real canon one.",1,112
"3 years old and still great: i received this kettle as a gift 3 years ago, and it still works as well as it did when i got it - it's never had problems. boils very quickly, holds a good amount of water, and works equally well with different water levels. my friend bought a different kettle after liking mine, and it almost boils over if you overfill it.",1,69
"glimmers of hope in the worst of circumstances: it's a trademark of danny boyle's films to show humans clinging to hope even in the worst possible circumstances---just think of the ending of trainspotting and 28 days later.sunshine follows a similar pattern, with seven astronauts and scientists attempting to reignite a dying sun by means of a stellar bomb, thereby saving the earth. that this could mean their own deaths is something that probably weighs on their minds as much as on the viewer's.the film will also put one in mind of alien, with the confining space of the ship and the intimacy of a small group. there's even a nod to silent running, with the greenhouse/oxygen garden on board.the film might have benefited by the inclusion of some bits of backstory on these people and maybe some transmission from their families back on earth. overall, however, it is an intriguing story.",1,151
"is this it: who cares if the strokes dress like ""bums off the streets""? who cares if the hives, the white stripes and the strokes are all the same? just listen to the album without caring what they dress like, or with the idea that they ""saved rock'n'roll"". it's honestly one hell of an album.",1,55
face the promise: i think it is the a very good album. it is so nice to hear bob seger again. all the songs are wonderful,1,26
"just as expected: the item arrived fast fast fast. the batteries work well, improve the distance on my car remote. very happy =]",1,23
"great lens!: the only possible minus i can think of anyone having with this lens is the barrel distortion at the edges...but frankly, that is one of the reasons i bought it. great pictures, smooth, crisp focus...good buy!",1,38
"enjoyable book: the poems are very random and use words in repetitve ways in different combinations. reminds me of zen koans to some degree, it was an enjoyable read. you will enjoy it if you like eastern poetry such as haiku etc.",1,42
beautiful picture: i have been looking for this blu-ray for my husband for some time. it hasn't been in any store i have looked and every else online had outrageous prices. i am so happy i looked on amazon before giving up. we popped it in our ps3 and the picture is absolutely phenomenal. i even ended up watching it with him.,1,62

"engrossing: i read this a while ago and remember it was so well written it literally transports you to places and eras with word painted pictures. currently reading her new book, perfect family and it too is just as engrossing.",1,40

"sweet summer read: i enjoyed this book a lot... i'm passing it along to my best friends. we happen to be a set of three very different georgia peaches ourselves. very sweet read, cute and refreshing.",1,36
mounting plate: this is a rugged ceiling plate for the money. the only negative is the rubber grommet that fits in the cable feed hole. it does not fit properly and cannot really be used.,1,35
"awesome phone: i use my cell phone extensively for about 75% of all of my calls... several hours per day. i usually have to get a new phone every year or so because they wear out. i had the original motorola razr v3 from verizon, and just upgraded to the razr maxx ve. don't listen to all the crappy reviews... while there may be better phones (or better providers than verizon who don't cripple phone features offered by the manufacturer), there is nothing wrong with this phone. i've been using it for about 3 weeks now.pro's -- compared to the v3, the sound quality is a little better, the buttons-hinges-ports are more well thought out, and the 2 megapixel camera is awesome... makes good prints!con's -- battery life not as good as i'd like... the v3 seemed to have longer battery life. the camera tends to shoot dark shots.",1,149
cool pictures!: this calendar contains pictures of some of the most famous lighthouses. my favorites are cape lookout and cape hatteras.,1,21
"now maybe george bush can help: now that we have a new president who is not bent on destroying the military, perhaps we can reverse the trends so well described in stephanie's book. we are closer to war than we have ever been since the removal of the berlin wall, and somebody's gonna have to pick up the slack. as soon as this book comes out in paperback, i'll be handing it out to my friends and colleagues who have not read it.steve waterman, author of just a sailor",1,89
"good introduction to parallel programming with mpi: this book is a great introduction to the theory of parallel programming. it is important to note that it is not a great reference for mpi, but it does a good job introducing the basic mpi functions and how to implement parallel programs using them.if you are looking for a good parallel programming primer, this book is a good start. if you are looking for an mpi reference guide, or a detailed discussion of more advanced mpi use, look elsewhere.",1,87
"the pushcart war!: this was one of the greatest books i read as a child! i loved the characters of the pushcart king, old anna, and wanda gambling. this is a great book for anyone who just likes stories that could be real, could have happened-but didn't. it's a sweet story and it can be enjoyed by kids 5 to 50. i would recommend this book to anyone. buy it! read it! love it!",1,74
"a great addition to the series!: i enjoyed visiting the brotherhood again in this book. the author did a great job expanding their world, and fleshing out the characters. i liked the hero and heroine, and thought the tension between them was satisfactory. the pacing was a little off, however. the conflict between mary and rhage was played out a little too long. and although i understand the author's rationalization of the cheat scene, it could've been an even better story without it. it wasn't necessary and detracted from the story. overall a good story, but not a 5-star this time.",1,101
"best toy ever!!: we purchased two of these trucks about 3 years ago for our then 2 year old twin boys. i have to say it is one of the best purchases we have ever made. we have a total of 6 kids (ages 3-11) and still to this day, this is the number one fought over toy. whenever they are outside they all want to play with these. they have been left in the weather, brought along on vacations, used hard and are still kicking, which is a lot more than i can say for most toys that have been through our household.after 3 years of hard use, they are still in pretty good shape. a few rust marks and dings and the plastic has some sun fade, but still plenty of life left.",1,135
"skateboard tough: skateboard tough is a book about a boy who had just moved to a new place. he made new friends and lived his life normal, until one day he discovers something buried in his back yard that changes his life forever. the events that happen next, i will not reveal. you have to get the book and read it yourself.it is a really awesome book. when i first saw the book and picked it up, i was really anxious about reading it. i had a fun time reading the book. anyone who reads this book will be amazed at how good it is.i would definately recommend this book to anyone who is a skateboarder or even not a skateboarder. anyone who likes nice, calm, soothing books, this is definately not the one. it is jam packed with surprises. therefore, i would definately recommend this book to anyone and everyone who enjoys reading.",1,154
review of braun 7526: i received my braun 7526 sooner than the date that it was promised and it looked like it was brand new. the sideburn trimer is excellent. the shaver works great but i think i have an easier time shaving with a norelco rotary.,1,47
only video to work for me: i wish this was in dvd format because i absolutely love this workout video. i own three copies because i was afraid that i had run my original vhs to many times.this is the only workout vhs that i became hooked on doing and i was able to loose 80 lbs. using it. i did it evey night for several months to achieve my goals. i loved the program to the point i felt let down if i had to skip a day of working out.,1,92
"excellent view of naval aviation and 'flying off the deck'.: campbell, brown, clancey...now bob norris. for those of you interested in aviation, flying, the integration of women in military aviation, and just a darn good read, this book is for you. the characters were well developed, the story line excellent, and i had trouble putting it down! anyone who has read books by the previous authors should add bob's name to their list. i hope that he continues writing from his experiences. i wouldn't even mind a non-fiction work that shows what really happened to those who were implicated, yet innocent in the tailhook scandal. there were hints of a story even there. good luck bob, i'll be looking for more titles!",1,122
"disappointing episode: before the frost was an excellent book featuring linda wallander as a police cadet who is pulled into searching for her missing friend anna. the tale is grim and horrific. the masterpiece theater version of this book does not even come close to following the book. instead, we find linda married and pregnant, with a very minor role, vastly different from the book, which revolved around her character. while i love branagh's wallander, the beautiful scenery, etc. this particular episode left me wanting more. read the book. it was so much better.",1,94
"comforting, comfortable, funny - you'll want to share it: this slim volume of prosaic poems (they are barely poems, more like very graceful essays) on encroaching senior-hood is really enjoyable. and comfortable, and comforting to read, much in the same way the classic ""golden girls"" tv show is, in a ""you're not alone in this aging business, all us women are going through the same things!"" way. i especially loved the ""new alphabet,"" which includes things like ""o is for osteo, p's for porosis,"" and the poem about the two lovers who can't take their eyes off each other -- and it turns out the ""man"" is her four-year-old grandson. thanks to judith for reaching through the la-nip/tuck-gym hardbody bs in this world, and telling it like it is.",1,129

"cheap and does the job: excellent price. no problem to install, 5-10 min. i actually installed only one side of the hinges and used a carabiner clasp on the other side as it was metal.",1,35
"incredible!: the author is very clear in his teachings. he knows how programign should be taught and even if you havn't programmed in any language or know how to use flash, this book will show you how to use and exicute your ideas to the fullest ability. tjis book was deffently a good book",1,54
"a welcome change for talk television: this show is one of the better talk shows i've ever seen, mostly because of the guests rollins gets to come on- bill maher, ozzy osbourne, kevin smith, paul thomas anderson, for example- and the fact that they're actually talking about real issues and aren't censored (this is also a bonus for the musical acts), instead of telling an anecdote or two. the musical guests are also great- jurassic 5, damian marley, and ben folds are among my favorites from season 1.overall, rollins makes a great show- interestings guests, great music, and his bits are consistently very funny.",1,104
i read the 13th print of this book in 1997; my second bible!: its a pitty that this book is only available in this language. there are a lot of original african people living in the diaspora who have because of slavery another language.for myself it was not only an eye-opener buth it became my second bible. i have done a lot with the information found in this book. for instance i upgraded the thoughts of a lot of surinam people living in holland.,1,84
"elegant, pretty, lovely dish - slicer scuffed: the cheese plate and the handle of the slicer are very nice. the blade was scuffed (the best word i can come up with). this tray was purchased to go with the winterberry dinnerware set. this is not fine china, rather it is very nice stoneware that is sturdy yet appears very elegant because of the delicate decor. all pieces came intact and there were no flaws in any of the pieces, with the exception of this one blade. every piece purchased was on sale, making it easier to buy extra pieces.",1,99
"spanky did that in the emerica video: well no actually he didnt but thats what owen wilson said. the video is ,just like girls previous videos, nothing short of amazing.it's funny in its own ways and has some cool special effects that just blew my mind when i saw em. the skating is just incredible. eric koston closes the video with one of the gnarliest enders i have ever seen.the video features a great deal of styles with parts from paul rodriguez,gino ianucci, eric koston, and rick mcrank.(sp?) the chocolate section is awsome. marc johnson just rips it like no one has seen with his totally great style. i highly suggest if you are a fan of skateboarding you buy this video.even the music is great. check it out now.",1,130

"suprisingly good: i dont have much to say about this album,,, however this is better than you would expect. ""country grammer"" is obviously a very good song, but the rest of this album is also good. lil wayne from the hot boys is on the song called ""for my.."". ""thicky thick girl"" is also good. you would expect this album to only have that 1 song but it has many other good songs on it also",1,76
"cute film: as far as animated films go, this is fairly cute. some people really like it, others don't, it will depend on your taste or if you like animal characters. overall an enjoyable film with some fun musical numbers and characters.",1,42

"keep in mind, this five stars for an _alien nation_ book: meaning they are qualified stars. i like the premise of alien nation, usually better than i like the actuality, but that's common on series sf tv... the alien nation books tend to be better than what we saw on tvs. besides this one i like, _body & soul_ and _passing fancy_. all are about what is to be tenctonese and human, that's an interesting concept to me.the reporter in this one is a not very veiled harlan ellison, imo, and i found that amusing. i also found a copy of _black like me_ at a used bookstore after reading this. telling _black like me_ in a sf mode is interesting, well done, worth reading if you don't end up paying too much for it.",1,135
"18-inch simulated lambskin 'spot vermont style' chew bone toy w/ squeaker.: my labrador retriever just loves this plush, over-sized bone-shaped toy, although it is not a chew toy as my lab has 'opened' it a couple of times over 6 mos. and we've had to sew it back closed. in spite of this, she loves the stuffed bone so much that the sewing occasionally is worth it. in terms of value, it is certainly worth <$10, but when you add 50%+ more for s&h it becomes borderline in terms of value. so i would give it 3-stars (ok product for $$) but my lab would give it 5-paws up as it is one of her favorite toys to run and play with. but we've had to limit any tugging with it as the seams just do not hold up to too much strain. for tugging with a big dog, try 3 knot tug rope bone - white (24 inch) which has been very durable for tug play.",1,167
"amazing: simply amazing book!there are so many good reviews here that i don't have to write one.as i just wrote above it is amazing, very interesting and enjoyable book.",1,29
"great music...: as a french jazz fan and drummer i think that lewis nash is one of the masters of jazz drumming, his musical contribution to the today jazz is very important.this album is a marvelous exemple of swing and musicality, what a great sound and a great feeling....thanks to make the jazz lives...",1,54

"perfect ginger tea product, and great for nausea & some upset stomachs: the product was great, and just what i had been looking for! i got a lot of it too, for such a reasonable price...and since i use it for nausea (the best remedy by far i've found) and some upset stomach issues, i use it a good amount! the whole interaction was good, the shipping fairly quick and product quality great & in perfect condition!",1,77
funniest book ever: i had to knock one star off because the book was way smaller than i thought it would be. i read it in entirety in about 3 hours. kind of selfish but her writing leaves you wanting more. but that being said it's a very quick read sure to make you laugh out loud. there were many times i had to stop and reread what i just read to my boyfriend so he could laugh as well. i love her books they are hilarious.,1,87
"cardio: i have the mat workout dvd which i really enjoy. i wasn't sure about the cardio dvd having read wildly varied reviews from ""love it"" to ""hate it"". but, i thought i'd give it a try anyway.my verdict: i really like it. it's not for everyone though.if you just want to put your workout dvd in the player and follow the instructor's commands, then this dvd is definately not for you.however, if you are prepared to put effort into learning routines then you will probably enjoy it. the start of the dvd she goes through each dance combination step by step. basically you can just keep rewinding and playing back until you get it. when doing the main workout she doesn't call out the next step or instruction - therefore you need to have spend the time learning the routines.the routines do take some time to learn, but with repetitions you will get them down pat. i have some dancing experience but not a lot.i like it because it's a bit different and fun to do. it's pretty high intensity cardio.",1,182
"brilliant: electrelane's axes finally arrived. it's been out for a week, i can't figure out what the hold up was but i am so happy with it. it is noticably not as catchy as the power out, which, probably i will be the only person that misses that. i like catchy. especially the way that one was catchy. with hooks so smart, if i were a fish i wouldn't mind losing my life to hooks like that. i would snap on. i would take the bait. they could reel me in.axes is starker, and more stockhausen, which is always popular with modern minds, not always mine. it's what john cale's paris 1919 should have sounded like, and was so disapointing and boring because it didn't. and it's a lot like that final, two-album leap that talk talk made when they transcended everything, when they abandoned pop for good and went free. i hope electrelane stick around though.",1,157
"shiva has done it again: i didn't know what to expect from this dvd until i actually got out on the mat and began to follow the practice. it's a challenging practicethat will build your core - not by doing ab work but by flowing in a graceful practice.although shiva guides you through the practice, she encourages you totap into your own flow and add your own movements to the program.the time flew by and i can't wait to do it again.this is a great workout for someone who only has a limited amount of timebut wants to move into the flow.if you are a fan of shiva rea, you'll enjoy this work.if you are not yet a fan of shiva, this dvd compliments her core abs and fluid power.i rated this dvd five stars. you may want to give it more.namaste and enjoy it!ps. my goal is to join shiva on a retreat in the near future. if you aren't on her list, sign up at [...] you'll get her monthly newsletter called pulse.",1,175

remember me series one of pike's best: remember me was one of the best books i have ever read. the characters were perfectly developed and the plot was wonderful. it was the kind of book that kept you guessing until the very end. i have read about 23 of christoper pike's books and have not been disapointed once. his books kind of give you an insight into the way he thinks and it is really amazing. i would reccomend this series to anyone.,1,83
"christie...more than yellow river: christie was a group either behind or ahead of its time...depending on your perspective. they were out of step with the early 70s progressive rock movement...but pre-dated the rock revival and glam rock scene by several years.this reissue of their first album (plus bonus tracks) is a long overdue gem. the songs are all catchy and riff laden mini-masterpieces. apart from their hits (""yellow river"" and ""san bernadino"") there's a wealth of great stuff to enjoy here...""country boy"" being a standout. a very highly recommended reissue. repertoire's remastering is exemplary.",1,94
"excellent and fresh investigation of godly character.: uncommon graces is an uncommon book. it is one of those rare offerings that brings together wisdom, insight, biblical integrity, freshness, and creativity, and presents it with clarity and economy. this is no dull laundry list of christian duties. it will both challenge and excite the reader. it was a real joy!",1,59
"purchased elsewhere after damaged shipment: unfortunately the hp 4050 purchased through amazon was damaged in shipment. processing of refund was smooth, but slow because of ups intermediate process. rather than try another shipment i went to a local source and found that they had the 4050 on closeout. so i got it for $50 less than it would have been through the amazon source.the scanner itself seems to work as advertised. instructions and manuals are very sketchy, but i have been able to muddle through. sometimes cold restarts are required if false starts or changes are made during process. processing of 16 slides at a time is slow, especially if multiple processes such as cleanup and color correction are requested. but the time it takes to catalog and add metadata for the images is similar to the processing time, so can go on concurrently for the previous set and no time is 'lost'.i didn't need the hp photo storage and organizing software automatically provided.",1,164
"very cool!: great quality poster! great size and easy to find a frame for. it arrived on time, and with great care taken to package it for shipment!!",1,28
"nothing here see. keep looking: if you love tennis maybe you'll like this game. if not, don't waste your time. this is not an awful game, don't get me wrong. everything is just too average. average soung, graphics, color.i am guessing this was an early release and neo geo was trying to get a quantity of games to market quick. in most cases they did a good job, however this is not an example one one. there are just too many better games for the ngpc.",1,86
great for slicing: this knife is such a great deal! it's perfect for slicing homemade bread. it is also great for veggies. i have also used it to slice a roast. great price!,1,33

"breathtaking!: this is a truly beautiful work. i've bought some cds at the local record store and was very disappointed before i wised up and started looking through the reviews here at amazon for some better material. this looks not like a western collection, but like an actual chinese cd. the liner notes have a rather melancholy feel to them, and this is reflected in some of the music showcased here -- piece number 4, parting and yang guan, is particularly moving. the instruments evoke deep emotions; one in particular (i don't know what it is called, but it sounds like a violin) literally does not ""play"" but rather ""sings"" these sweet, expressive, minor-keyed melodies. the haunting voice of this instrument weaves itself all throughout the pieces, narrating stories that are foreign and yet very, very real to a western listener. this collection really deserve the title ""masterpieces"". i only wish i knew where to find other works of this high quality.",1,162
"hope and staying true: how can you maintain hope in the midst of environmental degradation, waste, and human callousness? while not ground breaking, this is a thoughtful, beautifully written book about life's values and staying true to nature. i loved the chapter on fidelity. the author's relationship with his teenaged son while camping and hiking is both humorous and touching. a very good read!",1,64
"don't miss it: this performance is absolutely fantastic.the pieces are short, but full of content and maybe mompou is the more underated composer of the last centurythe playing of jordi masó is excellent.a must have.",1,35

steve raichlen best of barbecue: i like the steven raichlen rib rack very well. it will allow me to smoke 4 racks of pork spare ribs on my big green egg without any problem. the only complaint i have is i have used it only one time and some of the porcelain is coming off and that means rust. i guess 4 stars is pretty liberal for the rib rack because of the porcelain issue but it is the only one that i have tried that i can cook 4 whole racks of spare ribs and not have to cut some of the ribs in half,1,106
"very thoughtful: i have never really had any opportunity to interact with individuals afflicted with this unusual and often debilitating ailment. mark haddon's real-life experience with autistic children allowed him to craft this masterpiece by providing the perspective of a young autistic teenager's mind. christopher's why of thinking - and consequently, his actions - make logical sense, but because he lacks a normal person's ability to make intuitive connections or understand the unspoken, christopher has to rely on the imperfect set of rules he's learned about human behavior. haddon is a subtle and sensitive writer, leaving it to us to draw the conclusions that christopher can't.this is a book that i highly recommend to everybody - it is not only an interesting read, but also a great learning experience. another great book (actually a series of books) that i liked for its educational values is ""why some cats are rascals, book 1"".",1,152
"5 stars, most definitely: great cd. practically every song on this is good and enjoyable to listen to. if you like depeche mode, you will most definitely like this. depeche mode is a great group. they have great vocals and the music is like no other. there is a reason why depeche mode has been around for over 20 years. their music is top-notch.",1,64
"this book will change your life.: ...if your looking for a meaningful long term romantic relationship then this is the book for you.this book explains everything that is misunderstood about true love. it emphasizes building a foundation of friendship and respect, and in time romance. it even explains how to get the coldest people to warm up to you.this book shows how ""love is a predictable human response"". if your a logical person, this book explains love in logical terms. or actions and reactions.if your looking for help on how to inspirer and maintain a long term relationship, then this is the book for you.",1,105

invaluable if you want to improve - not for beginners: this is not a beginner book and it is not a learning book. it doesn't show you how to play classical guitar. this is a technique building book and it works extremely well at this task. this book is perfect for you if you have been playing classical guitar regularly and for some time now -if you are trying to grow in your ability past the beginner stage and the early intermediate stage.this book is something you should get if you have some time to commit to the guitar on a regular basis because the warm-up exercises and the various left/right hand exercises take time. just doing these exercises will take an hour of your playing time.if you already have a repertoire and you want to become more technically proficient then this book is perfect. the exercises really do work. if you have the time to commit to this book your playing will improve dramatically. it will help you identify and improve technical points that you are weak at.,1,179
"a very important movie for those who shop at wal-mart!: if you wonder how wal-mart got so successful, then this film is a great example. my only problem with the film was the exclusion of it's founder, sam walton. the film could have given a couple of minutes on who he was and the fact that he never intended on the company to ""sell out"" the us for goods made in china. despite that shortcomming, i'd recommend this film to those who depend on wal-mart. let them see exactly what their dollars are used for.",1,95
"great sax by sil austin: while sil austin is sil austin and there is no other like him, i was disappointed in this collection. more particularly i was disappointed in this version of danny boy. my husband and i own sil austin plays pretty for the people on a 33 1/3 record, and the version of danny boy on that album is a much more soulful arrangement...more sil austin, less backup instruments.the ""plays pretty..."" version gives me goose bumps every single time i hear it. the arrangement on great sax just does not measure up.hopefully the powers that be will see fit to release sil austin plays pretty for the people, a superior album of sil austin at his best. i will certainly buy it if they do.",1,128
great: i wish i'd bought the entire album. she's got an amazing voice and a great band. i wish that they had a better release in the us.,1,28

no complaints: my purchase took forever to arrive but it fell within the time they promised. they responded to my emails promptly.,1,22
old favorite: i love the story; it's a tearjerker for me. meryl is one of my faves and de niro has great rapport with her in this movie. seeing the fashions from the 80'a is always fun too :),1,39
"amazing movie: i don't often leave reviews but i felt that this movie deserved it. when you watch the trailer or read the description, this movie comes off sounding stupid. when it came out i decided not to see it but after my friend told me he saw it and i decided to check it out. this movie is great. it keeps you interested the entire movie and you are at the edge of your seat by the end. this movie has such a sad and wonderful story about jamil. all the things he went through. but there is no doubt this a 5 star movie. i have it pre-ordered and i cant wait to watch again.",1,117
"un cuento perecto: aunque toda la obra de garcia marquez es brillante, considero que ojos de perro azul goza de las caracteristicas de un cuento perfecto. es magico e inesperado. transporta al lector a un mundo de ensueño que se va revelando sutilmente. definitivamente, vale la pena leerlo, mas de una vez.",1,52
"worth the money: i bought this book, along with the a+ passport by mike meyers and passed both tests with no problem. with any cert test real world experience helps but with these two books, even a complete newbe could pass. the test software with the book was pretty solid, i've seen worse.",1,53

"move over harry connick, jr: i purchased this cd yesterday and i totally agree with the majority here matt dusk is a wonderfully talented new artist with a lush voice and he isn't bad to look at either. the title song ""two shots"" is a great song written by bono. my personal faves are ""lonely road"" and ""every mother's son"". for the reviewers who stated that there is nothing new and original here try listening to it again. i think ole blue eyes would be quite impressed with matt.",1,89
"advisable information: well this book is good but not good enough. because it truly puts you in a category and provides you suitable careers according to your personality type, i.e., what careers you'd possibly find enjoyable based on the functioning of your brain.but each type offers varied fields of career. for example, as in my infp type, you could be an actor as well as a psychological counselor. that means you have to pounder into what your abilities and interests are before you can find the right career.thus i worked with ""discover what you are best at"" by linda gale, which shows your aptitudes(abilities) to narrow the focus. and now i've found the right direction thanks to both books.",1,119
"organic bar with good taste and texture: this is one of the better tasting bars i've tried, but as always, your mileage may vary. for the most part, i'm not a huge fan of ""nutty"" bars, but this is an exception. while not packed with blueberries, the taste does come through, with just enough sweetness and a nice texture compared to many other bars that can be either too chewy or cakey. the organic ingredients are nice and this is certainly a good sweet-tooth alternative to candy bars and many of the other ""energy"" bars on the market that are packed with sugars. i think these would be great to carry along on a hike or other day outing where you want something quick. i'll be purchasing more of these.",1,130
"handy bag: i love this bag. it serves many purposes around the home, but my favorite is as a yard bag. it's light-weight, uses 30 gallon trash bags, stays upright, and has a large opening that remains open (i've had one or two that the opening has collapsed as it fills.) when done, this container collapses down and can be hung on a wall in the shed/garage/basement. it truly is a must-have.",1,72
mediocre monster movie: this is one of those lame teenager movies where the plot is based more on weird emotional expression than realistic plot conception,1,25
"green at his peak....: in my opinion green reached his peak somewhere around 1964-65. this cd is one of his very best. the collaboration bedwteen green, young and jones is super. on the opnener ""talkin about jc"" (john coltrane of course)young sets the groove, and then green starts to groove, for every 12 bar chorus he digs deeper into the groove. i am also very fond of ""luny tune"". it gives a kick when green takes off right after the lead, his guitar is singing, and his playing is flawless and totally relaxed. i always felt that jones and green goes very well together, and that is something that jones confirms in the biography about green, which is by the way highly recommended to all ""green fans"".(rediscovering the forgotten genius of jazz guitar, by sharony andrews green, miller freeman books)",1,140
"good movie: watched this one tonight for new year's eve and thought that this film was pretty good...in the beginning it does drag just a bit...but it quickly takes off with some twists and turns that you would not believe.a man is on death row for the murder of a woman, found dead on her living room floor, with her hands handcuff behind her back, a duct taped mouth and a plastic bag over her head that is duct taped around her throat. it is all signs of the perfect murder...but is it....watch this film and find out for yourself!!",1,100

"vivid, intense, adventuresome...eloquently written!: war and upheaval are never a scene where one might expect to find eloquently written images of love, fantasy and true friendship. vivid, intense descriptions of a young man's feelings rapidly brought on by the war, seem to become that of the reader. through the eyes of the main character, the reader is quick to learn the lessons of life and death with the war as the instructor. the author's skillful writing allows the reader to actually perceive to have the feelings, emotions and actions experinced by the main character; thus making the book most pleasurable and adventuresome!",1,102
"megadeth is awesome...: megadeth is still a great metal band since they first startedout. i saw them live once, they rocked! this is some of the best90s music i have ever heard... buy this cd. if you like it then you will definitely like their older stuff like rust in peace and so far, so good.....",1,56

got cheese: it was a christmas present. arrived very quickly and she loved it. wore it home from work (we live in mt).,1,23
"bubble up!: i adore this comp, probably becuse i love all bubblegum. i couldn't agree more that they should have used tommy roe's sweet pea instead, though the lyrics in jack and jill are amusing. i was a kid and my babysitters used to listen to bubblegum when i grew up in manhattan beach, ca and man this music brings it back! i am thrilled with the comp and the bubblegum classics series. now i don't have to cringe every time my 45s, which are all drawn on in crayon, skip! i was thrilled that they included the sweet on this comp. if you like little willy (which is slightly ""harder"" than the rest) you might enjoy their lp desolation blvd which is more early glam, but still features great teen lyrics and fabulous glam screams. rock on!",1,138
time out super audio cd: i expect this is a high quality cd. unfortunately i failed to spot the specialised new double layer music format until i discovered it was not recognized by any of my cd players.furthermore my local electrical store tells me that the new format will not be available in the u.k. for some time.,1,58
"very good fourth book: all the mystery and drama comes to a head in this book. the tri-coven struggles to move on without holly, who is enthralled to michael. he has devious plans of his own which if he succeeds will put him as the head of the supreme convent and have holly dead(old news there he has been trying to do that since book 1). this book is full of betrayal,love, lust and all the good things that we have come to love from this series. i think legacy was a little better, but i hope nancy holder plans a lot more of these books because they are too good to put down.",1,114
"the answer!: my wife and i read and digested somers plan, and changed our lifestyles and eating habits accordingnly. we both lost over 10 pounds (about what we needed to lose) and feel better than we have in years. it's a lifestyle change for us.somer's plan is similar to atkins, but with a twist. the nice thing about somers over atkins is that it allows you to eat fruit and other good foods. atkins is too restrictive in that area and you get bored with what you can eat. not so with somers. my wife got some of her recipes and we are eating good, staying full, craving the good stuff like meat, fruit, and veggies, and enjoying our food more all the time.",1,124
"great little kit: i have no complaints about this product for the money. i was afraid it wasn't going to fit my shop vac based on some other reviews, but i already had an attachment that allows me to use the tips from my indoor vacuum. the tip included in this one fit on top of that and allowed me to use all the accessories in the kit. i have already used this kit in the car, but my planned use for it will be cleaning out those little blades on my computer fans. the included hose makes it really easy to maneuver the attachments around.",1,106
"go to book: have owned multiple copies of this collection over the years, due to wearing them out. purchased a copy for a friend going through some rough times, and he still uses it as a reference. one of my ""go to"" books when i'm having a bad day, or need some guidance... highly recommended; read a passage and think about it for the day.zen flesh, zen bones classic edition: a collection of zen and pre-zen writings",1,77
book purchase: i thought that this was a very entertaining book. toby is not always a very likable person in this story but he is brutally honest about himself and that is part of what makes the book so entertaining. at times i did find it droned on too much about facts on who is who in the fashion industry which didn't interest me so much but it was still a fun read.,1,73
"a wonderful collection of traditional music: the clancy brothers are all blessed with magical voices, and perform these songs with power. the music on this disc is traditional irish folk that trascends time. classics such as ""brennan on the moor"" and ""johnny, i hardly knew ye"" are all here. i wholeheartedly recommend this disc.",1,54
"my favorite comedy film: they must hurry and put this out on dvd! i have recommended this film to countless friends/family as the funniest 'slice of life movie about a typical ny italian family'. some of the lines and situations will definitely hit home with anyone who has struggled with dieting. ""how'd you like to stuff that into a jelly donut"" or ""june love his corn""....priceless. dom d is so lovable and charming that i never even noticed he was overweight. and the chubby checkers? that entire scene when they get so passionate discussing their food faves while drinking hot water with lemon (""do you have any honey?"") is the best!",1,111
"great router: very pleased with the router, excellent adjustment feature, and smooth start. would highly recommend this router.",1,18
"true heroine: i think this is a great book that i just engulfed in one day; once you start, you just cant stop. it starts out when princess cimorene of linderwall has just had enough of of all the embroidering and etiquette (and all the other ""proper"" stuff a princess is supposed to learn). after getting the advice to run away from a frog, she ends up in a cave full of dragons, where she becomes kazul's princess. things are going great when all of a sudden princes and knights start trying to rescue her. and thats not all, she finds out that the wizards are trying to take over all the magic in the dragon world. you have to read this great fantasy/fiction book to find out what happends to kazul and princess cimorene. i suggest this book to people of all ages that like fantasy/fiction books (and to people who even don't like fantasy/fiction) because once you start you wont be able to put this humerous book down.",1,170

"didn't scare me: i got about every twin book available (like most people). being a first time mom most of them scared me with medical things that granted i need to know all of the maybes but i wanted a book to give me real life ""short cuts""she gave me info that i really plan on using (the mini fridge) and made me giggle a few times. i gave the book to my mom to read and she is enjoying it also. i wouldn't just get this book but it is a great book to read in 2 days and keep around for helpful hints.",1,105
"thoroughly comprehensive, yet surprisingly readable: i currently work in a cardiac surgical intensive care setting, and have found this book to be among the best hemodynamic texts available. its comprehensive presentation of anatomy, technology, and pathophysiology in relation to hemodynamics is arranged very intelligently. what i enjoyed most about this book though was its readability. the language is straightforth and simple without losing any of its meaning, which has lent to its popularity among nursing students performing clinical rotations in the unit. friends of mine who have borrowed this book invariably purchase their own copy afterwards. it is that good! i reccomend this book to anyone in a field where hemodynamics hold importance.",1,113
the legend begins...: alfred hitchcock - the legend begins is a great way to own some of the first films that hitchcock ever directed. i purchased this at my local walmart for $5 and it has been one of the best investments i've made in a long time. specifically because the 39 steps was on this collection made it all worthwhile. the quality of the discs are very good and the films themselves are well presented. 20 movies on 4 discs is a great value and the films are outstanding. pick this one up.,1,94
"quality prison movie...: a compelling film simply because in essence it is the love story of two convicts...willem dafoe is both brutal and gentle as a prison lord who befriends the young and naive ed furlong. throughout the movie, i was silent with fear...bravo buscemi for creating such a raw and human prison film without gratuitous violence and sex. in fact, more violence would've ruined the intensity of the film as a whole. and thank god for the few moments of comic relief&#65533;some of the only chances a viewer gets to release some of the pent up tension carried throughout the film. my only warning to possible viewers is this...be certain you are in the mood for a serious prison film when you watch, this is not a user-friendly piece of art.",1,132
"thrash revisited: i am glad the old thrash sound has been reformed ! this as with some other newer bands out are some great thrash albums . so if your into old exodus , anthrax and that style 80's thrash you'll love this !",1,44
"great atmospheric gangster movie: i really liked the movie le samourai. starring alain delon as assassin jef costello.. i always liked alain delon for such a pretty boy he sure plays great badguys and thats hard to do if your as good-looking as he is. alain delon plays a hitman, a lone wolf, when he kills a nightclub owner, a beautiful black pianist sees him close up but protects his alibi when she is questioned by the police. alain delons girlfriend in the movie and at the time alains real life wife, nathalie delon protects his alibi too. jef costello (alain delon) finds the police and double crossing mob associates hot on his tail. i wont ruin the ending and the great chase scenes but it was a very good film.",1,131

"easy install: mated this up with my k1500 suburban.. you will need a drill to elongate the the required 2 holes, one each side... i also recommend spraying the frame of your vehicle with a can of undercoat spray for a clean looking install. i also recommend an air ride kit of some sort. pulling any kind of weight will put strain on u joints if not level and addition strain on tranny. i towed 9,200 lbs.. cross country... strongly not recommended so please watch your weight limit, or you'll brake something for sure.......",1,94

"great for showering with confidence: i absolutely love this cast cover. super easy to use and shower with confidence.i spent three months in a cast and started with everyone's recommended trashbag. i did get the great idea to use saran wrap instead of tape and it was ok, but after the shower it was wet and messy. i read reviews on other items and saw things about how hard it was to put the covers on or that they broke after a couple uses. i didn't have any of that with this product.i wasn't sure what size to pick so i might have gone a bit larger than i needed but it worked out fine. the air pump makes it so that even if you do buy large it is suctioned to the right size - you just have a little extra material. it stretched easily over my cast and was easy to take off after.it was a little expensive, but worth every penny.",1,164
"great book to start getting organized: this book gives you great ideas about how to get organiazed and get things going. the only thing is that you will really need to use and get along ms outlook pretty well, else you'll miss some of the tips and tricks in the book.pretty good start-up place for those who need some pointers at how to classify and prioritize tasks, events, items, and almost everything.",1,72
"this a parenting must have.: if lisa was in little rock we would be great friends! i am always blessed by her charm and wisdom. as the mother of two, i have found creative correction to be wise and wonderful. my children are such a joy to be around (we do have our moments) and lisa's books have deepened our relationship with them. lisa, thank you for giving your life away! i highly recommend her books.",1,76

""knife in fhe water"" has but 3.the sexual tension & temptations of the three, would later be recaptured in 1989's ""dead calm"".herein, lay the original. in polanski's native polish yet provided with subtitles, we watch a stressful dynamic unfurl while a couple minding their business during an outing on the sea, find the need to assist a stranger in apparent need of help.the result, should you see someone in distress, would you help? do you keep going? in today's society, unfortunately, if you want to live, pass on by....",1,102
very professional!: i received this cd almost immediately! glad to be able to purchase at such a good price . thanks for the great service!,1,25
"works as advertised: works just fine on my archos 504. as other buyers have noted, similar generic products will not work on archos players; it has to be specifically compatible with archos. sound and video quality met and exceeded my expectations. i haven't tested this, but i would guess that using this cord prolongs battery life as well (because the player doesn't have to power its lcd screen, the biggest power-draining feature).",1,72
very entertaining saga: i really enjoyed this book and its characters. it kept me interested the entire way. this is one of those 'must reads' for everyone.,1,27
"durable, durable, durable: this thermos is amazing. it stayed hot for 1 1/2 days. it never leaks and, after falling down a flight of 13 steps onto a hard tile floor, it didn't leak, break, or even dent - the handle and all remained as new! it's easy to clean with a drop of detergent inside, close and shake well, rinse and let dry (it is not meant to ever be washed in a dishwasher). the capacity is large enough for more than four good 8 ounce cups of hot or cold beverage in a day. highly recommended and great value and longevity for the cost.",1,106
"imho not for children: i found the beginning to be interesting, albeit kind of sad. but when it turned to what i guess is an opiate trip, it got downright creepy. gave me nightmares.i'd heard of it forever and i'm glad i read it. but i would not read it again.",1,51
"epic theatre: this is a very enjoyable production. although some people may not like some of the actions on the stage, i think they're necessary because the salzburg stage is simply so large! besides, they're mostly very appropriate. jerry hadley and catherin malfitano are excellent leads and they've got excellent support from gwyneth jones, cornelius smith and wilbur pauley. this is the kind of epic theatre envisaged by brecht and weill. the picture and sound qualites are very good.",1,79
"great bouncy seat: this bouncy seat has worked well for us. i like to snug, enclosed feel that the canopy provides, as well as the 4 location where toys can be attached. the music modes are pleasant and not too loud. i like the fact that the music turns off automatically after awhile, otherwise i would forget and run through allot of batteries. the vibration mode, however, keeps running until you turn it off and is a great soother when the baby is fussy. one note of caution is that the wire frame legs extend out a bit from the seat itself. this makes the seat very stable, but also makes it easy to hit your toes on it. or maybe it's just me. all-in-all, we love this bouncy seat.",1,130
"eisler continues his great series: i read this book several years ago and actually have a signed copy by the author, which makes it even more special. i've really enjoyed reading the ""rain"" series and look forward to reading the next book. barry eisler does a great job of keeping the reader on the edge as he tells the story.",1,60
"i love soul food: i've been eating/cooking soul food for almost my whole life and i thought i've tasted everything but there is an actual ""soul food seasoning out now called annabelle's soul food seasoning... it gives that down-home southern cooking taste that you just hope you get close to when you cook soul food. so if you buy this book buy annabelle's seasoning too it's also sold on amazon--- it will take everything to the next level... from one soul food cook to another... thats a promisegod bless",1,89
"""one of a kind"": the universal reformer video series are ""one of a kind"" accurate instructional tapes of the original pilates method as taught by joseph h. pilates, on apparatus he designed. i use these videos to compliment the lessons i take with certified instructors. i am constantly learning corrections to my form and movements as i can clearly observe the exercises and listen to the insightful and in-depth instructions. i recommend these videos for beginning students to those becoming instructors. the talented certified instructors who demonstrate these exercises are an inspiration to watch! i look foward to learning these exercises as my physical ability continually improves and expands into more advanced forms. these videos teach you exactly what pilates is and how to perform the method safely and correctly.",1,130
music for life: absolutely perfect soundtrack. francis lai composed an exciting and very touching music. i recommend this item to anyone who really loves the international music. as we say in argentina: bravo!!,1,33
i am going to add little black book to my book of fav movies: this movie was the instight to relationships everyone needs to have. this book was as true as it gets. brittney murphy and ron livingston were wonderful. holly hunters character was great too but you wanted to smack her in the end. this is a movie about a girl who's life was being lived by example of her mothers. she ends up in love with a wonderful guy and he ends up leaving on a business trip. with the coxing of her peers she decides to check into his past relationships and starts to nose around in his palm pilot for insight to his past relationships. its funny how she comes to a relaziation about her relationships and relationships of others. this movie could not be more true to fact. loved every minute of it. sound track was wonderful and made the movie. three cheers for little black book. watch this movie today and may you find the perfect relationship.,1,173
"history of the j.g.brill company: a superb book. very well researched and complete. more than just the story of a family and the successful business enterprise they built, it brings to life an earlier era. debra brill has a marvelous writing style and i hope she continues to write for our enjoyment. much less dry and more enjoyable to read than most histories. highly recommended.",1,65
a good starting point: this book is great for someone who is interested in casting plastics and wants to get some basic experience without buying thousands of dollars worth of machinery. it is written well with lots of hints on how to keep the cost down as well as things he tried that didn't work out so that you don't make the same mistakes.,1,64
"a thoughtful faith: lauren winner, a frequent writer for christianity today and professor at duke divinity school, opens her story to us so that we might have a glimpse of what it means to wrestle honestly with both the jewish and christian faith traditions in the postmodern world. i'm deeply impressed with her honesty and tenacity in holding these elements of her life in creative tension: she loves the way judaism shaped her love for text and ritual and singlemindedness toward god, but she is unafraid to explore why she became drawn to jesus and christian theology. i recommend this memoir for those who are interested in understanding a personal account of what draws a person to an intellectually rigorous faith amidst a culture of skepticism.",1,126
"this is truly a page turner!: i loved this book, it fully held my attention and i wanted the outcome to be good for the characters. however, i must say that i did think that at some points the characters were more like caricatures. granted this may be intentional on the part of the author, but i didn't care for that aspect of the book. the heroine, dolores is not really a standard heroine as at some points you feel that she really is her own worst enemy, but it is because of this that the author successfully conveys her humanity to the reader. she is a poor broken soul looking for a peaceful life, whatever she considers to be enough just to keep her balanced. finally, all i want to say is, read this book, it is a swift read because you do want to find out what the eventual outcome will be!!!!",1,154
"what a voice!: this is probably my favorite album by randy travis, and definately a must-have for anyone who enjoys randy's music. he gets you with every song -- with warmth, humor and that gorgeous deep voice! it's like he's right there, singing to you, telling you his story. the fun ""if it ain't one thing, it's another"" probably describes your life perfectly! the beautiful ""long on lonely, short on pride"", ""i wish it would rain"" (""so she won't see what she's doin' to me"") and ""future mister me"" and ""price to pay"" are rich with emotion, humility, and honesty, -- they are all soooooo good! need upbeat and twangy randy? -- check out ""would i"" (he had to be dancing when he recorded this one!) you will not be disappointed!",1,131
"so, so good!: i love this book! it so well written and so engaging. the author writes with such a clear, authentic voice that i had a hard time believing that a man actually wrote it.",1,36
"wonderful, but don't expect the same as the movie: this is a great album, but the songs are not the same as the movie. (1) some important songs are missing, (2) some of the lyrics have been changed, (3) in the movie some of the other actors sing certain lines, whereas on the cd they do not.",1,57
"todd murrison, the teacher: todd murrison demonstrates a wonderful range of techniques for beginners and tackles basic layout for intermediate. as an accomplished graphic artist, todd explores more graphic applications, than freedom of expression, which this medium can not be separated from. we're waiting for todd to break the mold in his second book to see all that wonderful talent flurish. although i do recommend this book as a good one for beginners!",1,73
worked just like expected....easy to install: it was easy to install and the hardest part was just running it through the fire wall to mount on the dash. it's a great product for the money and works great.,1,38
"fun, nice challeges.: fun game, better graphics than i had anticipated. nice challenging ai at times.",1,16
"delightful: another good book, not quite as good as some of the others, but still a pleasant read. precious ramotswe is busy. she is moving her detetective office into her fiance's business to help cut costs as her detective agency is not doing as well, financially, as she would like. her fiance is not feeling well and she is trying to help him plus take care of a couple of orphans and solve her cases. her character is one of warmth, kindness, generosity and strength. one of the things that i like about these books is that i get a glimpse of what life is like in botswana, africa.",1,109
"absolutely great garbage: should also have supervixen on this cd.some almost hard rock, some generally great music & vocals.good mix.",1,20
"her best book yet: linda hall has done it again! this book is sure to be a best seller! katheryn's secret is a weaving of suspence and intrigue. right when you think you're on the right trail, she throws in another twist. anyone who loves a great mystery will love this book. it's a tale about family secrets, the effects of a legalistic, religeous upbringing and how god can work through the misguided mistakes of family. it's about love, lost love and love rekindled. linda shows us--without being preachy--the difference of being religeous and having the love of god in our hearts, where we learn to love others. her characters are real and well developed, as is the plot. by the time you finish this story, you may find that you identified with one or two of her characters and hopefully--learn from their mistakes.",1,144
just what i needed: just as advertised and what i was looking for. arrived in a timely manner and works to keep the car cooler in desert heat.,1,28
typical snowmen fun: i love the snowmen books! they have limited text and allow children to make up the story as they look at the book.,1,26
"graphic sf reader: this book has swamp thing in outer space for a fair part of it, as he encounters various other dc figures in his travels, such as those from the planet rann, and the odd green lantern, and even the new gods.he does eventually end up back on earth, and is a little peeved with some of the bad guys.as the shadow would say, if swamp thing is after you, 'the weeds of crime bear bitter fruit.'",1,79
"excellent cd!: great voice, great songs. way, way better than queen of ghoul's newly released overrated all-squeaks cd!",1,18
"jeannette: these cute little s & p shakers are a must have! whether you are having a crowd or not its nice to have a little set for each guest. the pepper shakers can't take a coarse grind so i offer my guests the pepper mill if that's what they prefer. if you are having company for a small amount of money they are a great addition. i have given them as gifts, too and are well appreciated.(show up at your thanksgiving house as a guest with them all filled.. you will be a hit!)",1,95
"not too shabby: out of all the shinai i have seen, these are pretty good. the leather at the tip could be a bit tighter i think. thats its only downfall. it still holds together pretty well none the less. also, for the price i would suggest getting these.",1,49
good for what we needed!: we placed game show board games out as center pieces at our company meeting and this was a fun one to display. the game came on time and in great condition!,1,36
"how to draft a strapless bodice sloper for evening wear!: this book is not for beginners in dress drafting. but even though i'm a novice, i did find the information informative... drafting dressy clothes requires starting with a different sloper rather than the slopers used in the drafting of regular daytime garments. the books on this subject are hard to find and limited, so this book would still be helpful for someone seeking information on drafting evening garments. i believe it is meant to be a supplement to further study. i would say that it would help someone who already is intermediate or advanced in drafting to start exploring drafting evening garments. i did enjoy this book very much!",1,119
"just plain good fun.: this cd doesn't have the lyrical depth of an offering from, say, jars of clay or dc talk. nor does it have the intricate musical detailing of either of those artists.but this cd is just plain fun. i blare it in the car and sing out loud on the way to work. the messages that everyday sunday shares are solid, even if simply phrased. wake up, o sleeper, and rise from the dead, and christ will shine on you. everybody's looking around and wants to be found...and i'm just hanging on. i will stand up now; i will not look down; i will do my best to wear this crown...but i need you as you guide me through today.everyday sunday is a great guitar-and-drums band. their lyrics are wholesome, their sound is fresh, and they rock without really telling us why. they just do.",1,148
"interesting: i've only seen the story of everything episode, myself, which i thought was actually amazing. very informative and interesting and genius without being too complicated (for those without a science background). i thought it was eye-opening. i got this dvd for my dad and they started out with the aliens episode which, according to them, wasn't so great. their complaint was that the dvd seemed to make up alien creatures and it was founded on nothing. they thought that anybody could make up whatever they wanted about aliens. this won't deter me from watching that episode in the future. of course the aliens in the dvd were founded on nothing since there's no available evidence to go on.",1,119
"just wonderful.: this ink is not dark black, not medium black, not gray - it's light black. i didn't know it was possible for a light black not to be gray, but what do i know? you learn something new everyday. thank you amazon!",1,44
great for sunday school teachers: have you ever had a late saturday night trying to come up with ideas for church in the morning? i found this book wonderfully refreshing and full of creative ways to bring god to children. it also made me begin thinking of news ways to bring the bible alive.,1,54
"whales and poetry of melville: whales alive is a fascinating excursion into not only whale songs andoutstanding music surrounding them written by the paul winter group,it is also amazing for the readings by leonard nemoy on melville'smoby dick, passages that are truly poetry in prose form. the musicsets the mood for the readings, and the passages set the style forthe music--a symbiosis of sound.",1,64
"go ahead and order more than one: if you've never heard of this before, you're not alone. after you've watched you're going to think of several friends who would absolutely love it who have also never heard of it. rather than risk losing your copy when they start passing it around, might as well order more than one. they make great gifts!signed,andy richter (ha! not really...)p.s. if you liked this you'll lovethe tick - the entire series.regards,andy's friend, patrick warburtonp.p.s. don't forgetgreg the bunny - the complete series, guys.love,seth greenseriously, if you love any of these and haven't seen any of the others, you'll probably love them, too. all great series. all more than a little bit warped. all cancelled before their time. and when you throw infirefly - the complete series... wow, do those guys at fox know how to make bad calls on good shows or what?",1,149
"start them on blackford oakes when they're young.: i tend to not appreciate fiction. i read a lot of brain candy as a child, but one day in my early teens i picked up this book.1) i met william f. buckley, jr.2) i saw revolutionaries from a different angle.3) i developed a desire to read books with substance.4) i was innoculated against steinbeck.it's engaging fiction that young people can enjoy. let them get a little bit of this perspective before their pinko profs get them.",1,85
great help with plantar fasciitis!: this support and the night split fixed my plantar fasciitis when nothing else did. highly recommended! buy this!,1,23
"a masterpiece, a mind's voyage to its own feelings: this film made me cry, scream, and tremble with emotion. it inspired me, it made me see the world in a different way. the fact that this film is out of print terrified me, i had it once but soon got lost, most probably in some guy's hands. i got to have it. i need it.",1,65
"makes you want to think: linklater's movies are unique. this one submerses you into visual and intellectual stimulus unlike the others. the visual effects alone will blow you away. the overlaying score feeds the other half. if you like to follow the ""why?"" that your head seems to ask sometime, this film will definitely scratch the itch.",1,57
"a movie for everyone: this is a very touching movie that will bring out your emotions (if you have a pulse). you will feel sadness and anger, but feel good at the end. i first saw the movie on cable, and ordered the dvd 10 minutes into the movie. the movie left such an impression that i had to track down and buy the book, the grizzly king, which the movie is loosely based on. i believe everyone will enjoy this movie, if they can understand the meaning ...",1,89
"does as says: this product works well but i find that it is difficult to keep in place when using. even with the clamp fastened, i found that the strainer would move around on me. i tried putting a towel down and even a rubber mat underneath the strainer and clamp but it still managed to loosen and move. it's a little tricky to hold the unit, turn the handle and also push the items through at the top. might be better if you have someone to help. also, when working with fresh quartered tomatoes, it's a little bit difficult to crank through the first time. i found that if you drop the tomatoes into boiling water for a few seconds, it will help to soften them which helps them pass through the strainer a little easier.",1,137
"great for running with my 2nd gen nano (lime): they must have fixed the problem with the 2nd generation ipods not fitting because mine fit perfectly without any stretching or tugging. this is great for running/exercising. i was able to figure out how to make it fit my wrist (6.5"") without cutting it or having any extra overhang. i am very pleased with the quality for the price! the case is neoprene with a clear plastic window. the strap is nylon (i think).",1,83
"end of evolution mass extinict & biodiversity: end of evolution mass extinict & biodiversity by ward,peter is a brilliant look into the history of planet earth and the life that once inhibited this planet. throughout the history mass extinctions have occured resulting in the destruction of old world also resulting in the evolution of a new world. throughout the book dr. ward describes these mass extinctions and warns of another mass extinction that may take place if human beings are not careful. i strongly advice anyone who is remotely interested in geology or in any sciences to read this book!",1,100
"absolutely splendeliciously beautiful!: wow!!!! this book is as much an art book as it is a knitting pattern book. it is beautiful to look at over and over again.it is not for any but the most experienced knitters and even then it can be formidable.however, it is inspirational, challenging, and beckons me to improve my knitting skills so i can tackle some of the most beautiful color patterns i have ever seen!i highly recommend this book.",1,76
"daniels makes literature circles practical for all disciplines/ages: this book, along with william zinsser's writing to learn, provides great tools for a teacher's toolbox. student voice and choice, according to research, results in better process and product. daniels is a practitioner--not merely a theorist--and his book shows this to be true as he provides practical, hands-on approaches to using literature circles in the classroom. these alternatives to ""drill-and-skill"" and ""stand-and-deliver"" approaches will result in renewed learning that will increase student engagement and motivation. yes, your classroom will have to be student-centered to use these strategies. it might be a little noisier...and much more engaging.glenn drysdale",1,105
the whole family had a blast playing this game.: this was great fun but don't count on using it more than once. the paper is rather thin and the scotch tape rips it.,1,33
my favorite movie!: schindler's list has fabulous acting and an outstanding director. this is my favorite movie and i'm in the 7 grade! schindler's list gives an excellent description of what happened during the holocost. this is a have-to-see movie!,1,40
"best water based poly on the market!: i have tried many other water based polyurethanes out there, but none other has the excellent coverage of zar. i can not even get it locally anymore and have to buy it on the internet with paying for shipping and handling on a liquid and still think it is worth every penny !!!!",1,60
terrific product terrific price: i bought this for my five year old granddaughter for christmas. and my daughter wants one now. it is very well made and looks very elegant. i don't think it was intended for a child but my granddaughter loves it. makes her feel all grown up. great product! not cheaply made like the price would make you think.,1,62
"this book makes you think: i was excited, yet skeptical when i opened this book. ireceived it at work, and as i opened it in front of my bossan a co-worker, i thought to myself, ""this cover lookspretty thought provoking..i hope they don't think i'm somekind of weirdo."" well, brodie's book is exactly about these""responses"" to memetic programming. if you are at allinterested in questions about why we think the things wedo, and how much of what we think is programmed rather thanconscious decision, then you'll want to read this book.not only does it get you thinking, it gets you to gettingothers thinking. whether you (or they) like it or not!the book is itself a ""virus of the mind."" (evil laugh...)",1,121
"surprisingly fascinating: i devoured the first few chapters of this book within days of receiving it. from that point, i skimmed for time's sake. i found the book wonderfully informative and interesting. mendelson is hard-core and old school about housekeeping, and i absolutely loved it. she reminded me of a paternal aunt, unabashedly sharing her wisdom and filling in the gaps my mother left. some pieces of the book left me stunned yet giggling, such as this gem: ""if you cannot avoid having only sandwiches one day, the rational response is to feel slightly sorry for yourself, not to blame yourself."" reading this book gave me knowledge and background information in order to change some of my habits and begin a new lifestyle, even if i didn't go ""all the way."" thank you cheryl for inviting me in!",1,138
"3 letters... w o w!!!: i must say she is amazing...every song on this c.d. makes u wanna get up and dance!! and thats what its all about.. my fav tracks ""love again"", ""when the moneys gone"", ""a diff. kind of love song.."" i just wanted to make this short cause you know how good cher is...i don't have to keep on telling u, its living proof.",1,67

"the only album that led me to write a review: excellent. heavy riffs. masterpiece of stoner metal.thanks natas for producing this one but really sorry that you doesn't get the fame you deserve.i'm still having 10 new cd's to listen to, but can't get out of this one !",1,49
"family favorite: if you love the muppets you will love the muppet christmas carol! this is one of the best versions of the christmas carol because it pretty much stays true to the original storyline, but it will not bore you out of you mind. this is a film for young and old. great music, great humor, great characters, great muppetry!!! this is my families all-time favorite christmas movies.",1,69
"beneath a rising moon: another entertaining read from keri arthur. this ripple creek series must be before the riley jensen, guardian series because the wolf shape-shifters clothes don't shred when they shift shape. lol i don't agree that the wolves in either series are werewolves. werewolves only change on the night of the full moon. the wolves in her books are shifters, not werewolves. just my opinion.",1,67
"great relaxing program: not only is the program very relaxing, i have been using it for a month and have felt significant reduction in my hip pain.",1,27
"i can't wait to read it again!: most books i don't think i'd want to read twice but i'm definitely gonna read this book again because it was one of those books you gotta read twice to enjoy it thoroughly. i also could've sworn i sensed gayness in there at some point. it was a complete book, though, which i liked.",1,61
not your usual network series: i have been a fan of stana katic since seeing her in the librarian: the curse of the judas chalice. well written dialogue. diverse cast of characters.,1,32
"the best peeler ever!!!!: i love this peeler. the serrated edge allows it to pierce the skin of fruits and veggies and it just glides along so nicely. also, the metal eye remover on the end works very well, much better than peelers with plastic eye removers. i know they call it a ""soft-skin"" peeler, but i've used it on potatoes and apples and eggplant with beautiful results. since we got it, we now fight over who gets to peel the veggies! that never happened before!",1,86
"welcome to steve aylett.: this book will make you laugh, because it is very, very funny. i firmly believe this.",1,20

"blues galore!: this film is basically the same as the first movie from the 80s, but you've *got* to have it because of the music. many, many great blues musicians play in this movie at the end of it, including legends like bb king, eric clapton, james brown, bo diddley, aretha franklin and many, many others.this is a must-have!",1,59
smartest kid ever: i can't believe how much my 18 mth old has picked up from this dvd. she absolutely loves it and wants to watch it all the time. she can now see a letter and make the sound on her own! it has also helped her to use more words. would recommend to anyone with a young child.,1,60
very good travel brush: this is a very nice badger brush. it is even better because of the portability. it packs very well and seems to dry nicely even if it is put into my toiletry bag just after use.,1,40
"important album, urgent issue: the nearly relentlessly racism and self-hatred in rap music, movies and other mainstream culture is utterly out of hand and despicable in a democracy. who's to blame? anyone who'll do anything for money! stevie wonder is right, this whole album is about a ""misrepresented people.""",1,49
"one of the best sports books i've read in years: i loved this book very much. the first chapter's descriptions of bonds breaking mark mcgwire's record is nothing less than pure poetry. the writing just rolls off the page, placing me in the chilly night air (""in a town that mark twain once said was the coldest winter he ever spent in the summer""), to the fabulous descriptions of how sports are the one place where we can lose ourselves and see man's heroism without life and limb being on the line. who else writes like that? murray in his prime maybe. this is a book about history, and baseball history second.",1,112
"boogie on foghat...boogie on!: too many folks think nothing good ever happened to foghat after stone blue but they are terribly mistaken as boogie motel, with foghat exploring some of their musical roots is definitely one of their most under rated original lineup releases. all i can say is more, more, more! pair boogie motel with zig zag walk for a rollicking rock n roll, boogie and bluesy fun musical trip!",1,71
"outstanding series - must see: excellent character and plot development. each episode reveals a little more on each. mini cliff hangers at the end of each episode makes you want to watch the next.

"wonderful film and cast: woody allen's personal life turned off many people, but that should not take away from his talent. he is still brilliant at capturing ""a slice of life"" and making it entertaining. it's fine to judge movies, but let's stop judging people.",1,45
"stunning! an epic adventure beyond compare.: the long walk is one of the most fascinating stories i have ever read and was almost lost to the annuls of history, but for the chance encounter of a yeti. just read the book to understand what i am saying. it is a book you cannot afford to miss",1,56
"first time ""grisham"" reader!: i just finished the brethren, and i really enjoyed it! i have never read one of john grisham's books before, and i have heard that this was definitely not one of his best. however, as much as i enjoyed this one, i look very forward to reading more of his books. it was interesting, and the plot was fascinating to me. you wanted to read to the end, to see what would happen.",1,77
"the best, better than the 1959 remake!!: i saw this movie on tv many times as a child, and everytime i saw it i would cry at the end. i have read other reviews about how the movie is dated and ""politically incorrect"", c'mon people this movie was made decades ago, and for it's time, it was and is dynamite, i will always remember the scene at the end where, the maid has literally died of a broken heart,'cause her daughter has rejected her. there is a funeral procession led by beautiful white horses, and mahalia jackson is singing at the funeral , and the maid's daughter running behind the funeral procession, screaming ""mama, i'm sorry!"". this movie is my absolute all time favorite.",1,124
"listen carefully!: whoever thinks ""deep end"" is about suicide should really listen carefully to the lyrics. whoever thinks madchild doesn't listen to bars should consider that maybe madchild doesn't give a [damn] and considers that his style. i love bad dreams as well as every one of my swollen cd's. each mc's style is unique: prevail is brainy. madchild uses ancient and fantasy based ideas. bad dreams is the cd that you pop into the cd player in your car during a long midnight highway drive. excellent.",1,87
"wonderful!!: this is a very good nancy drew book.even though it took me a lot of time ot locate,i'd say it's really worth the hunt.in this book,cindy austin,the daughter of two biochemists vanishes from her house so as to challenge nancy to find her.but when she gets kidnapped the second time,she's kidnapped for real.read on and you'll know what happens next.i'm proud i bought this book.you will be too,once you get it.",1,72
"good product, but not what the picture showed.: excellent product. the only negative was that the product i received was not like the picture. i was trying to match a set of four that i bought previously. when they arrived, they were yellow not blue, and a slightly different style. they do work with my other units, but i could have bought the yellow ones for half the price from another seller.",1,72
"forever love: this book wasa great read. i was truly surprise how the job choices for jon end up. i enjoy the tour that i went on with this book, places good and bad, just thinking about the food was really great for my mind-eye. since i live in new orleans mardi gras is something that i know about,the carnival season in the book was great. the way that self-hate and hate of family was display in the book would give other a good food for thought. there were so many characters in this book that it was just fun to read and see how their life would bend in the story and who would feel the effect of their bending. the cover of the book is what the reason that i pick up this book because the male in the far back call to you. again this was a great read and a fun book to try to figure out, plus i couldn't go to the first chapter and then the last chapter without missing somethings.",1,177
"great personal heater: this heater is super quiet and blows out a steady stream of warm air. i always have to have air blowing on me, and i find that ceramic heaters are either too hot or too loud. this heater is whisper quiet and perfect for chilly nights.",1,49

"excellent knife that feels ""right"" in your hands!: i picked-up a 10"" wushtof chef (the one on this page) and a 6"" chef when i was in germany and i love them. the 10"" is large enough that you can cut large items and also has a wider blade that helps with ""proper"" chopping technique for those of us who are not ""professionals"". of course, the wider blade also allows you to scoop-up a good amount of ingredients for transfer to where-ever you need them.even for being such a large blade, the knife is light, balanced and easy to handle. i anticipate that these knives will last me a lifetime if properly cared for (for example, i always use the honing rod before use which will help prevent the need for sharpening). i recommend these knives to everyone i know who enjoys cooking even the least bit and i feel it's better to have a few well-selected quality knives than one of those ""sets"" of cheapies (most of which are filled with blade styles you'll never use anyway).",1,178

"this book makes sense out of dramatic business changes.: tom has reframed the way we look at business growth. the failures of incrementalism and continuous improvement models are clearly illuminated in this insightful book.but tom went'z ""transformational change"" does just leave the reader with a critique of what not to do, he provides the business leader with a formula for creating a transformational strategy.we have frequently heard that leadership involves the courage to take risks. tom provides leaders with a formula for taking well thought out risks to create the future for themselves and their business.",1,96

"continuing the trend set with ""a kind of magic"": queen's previous album, ""a kind of magic"", was a return to form, and ""the miracle"" continues that trend. this is a very good album, better (imho) than the albums they released in the early '80s. it is an extension and continuation of the styles they implemented in ""a kind of magic"", which they would refine in their next album, the excellent ""innuendo"".",1,71

"to dissolve the doubts of others: to dissolbe the doubts of others, i would like to say that this book is a tribute to lor. but if you think about it, arent' most books or movies a tribute to something. every type of writing has a basic idea that most books follow.this book is a non-stop page turner, unlike lor (no disrespect to j.r.r. tolkien) also the underdog hero is much different in background and otherwise.besides that i find that the only part that slightly resemble lor are moria and mountains names the grimwall. the more i think about it the less the two books resemble each other. the idea that this book is even slightly plagaristic sounds crazy to me.i hope that my review has undone some of the damage done by a barrage of falsity.",1,137
"long time love of my book collection: i love this book. i bought it at a book fair at school probably as it came out in paperback... i read it in one day and loved it. i am now in my 20s and still pick this book up when i am feeling like a good love story that i know i have had relation to... anyone that isn't to ashamed to let the kid out in them should definitely read this book, and anyone that is a teen with some mom and dad issues when it comes to dating, should really read this one!",1,104
"berganza bloodless? oh please!: teresa berganza is the greatest carmen ever, period. no other carmen has ever understood this role better. berganza lacks nothing in fire. it's just that carmen is not a pre-pagliacci verismo opera. regina resnik recording is such a vulgar affair, that it fully deserves mario del monaco as don jose. the only carmen worse than that is horne's in dg.",1,64

"inexpensive... the way to go.: it really frustrates me how i can't find something like this at a best buy or circuit city without paying at least 40 bucks. i'm not much of a video-phile, but this cable will get the job done and things still look incredible on my 50"" samsung dlp. i was using this to connect my non-hdmi cable box to my tv. of course you'll still need the red and white audio cables to go along since dvi doesn't carry an audio signal.",1,87
"the first toy my daughter smiled at, but the mirror might as well be tinfoil: my daughter has loved this toy since she was a month old. once she developed the social smile, i would catch her smiling in response to the firefly's smiley face.now she is almost five months old and she likes to grab and chew on various parts of the toy, but does not find the teether particularly interesting.i did give freddy the firefly a bath in the washing machine in a mesh beg and cold water without detergent, as it makes no sense to give to your child a cloth toy that you know she will chew on without washing it first. the crinkly stuff still works, even three washes later.i am not fond of the mirror. the only thing it has in common with a mirror is the name, otherwise it's just a shiney surface, which, i guess, is ok, since it's a safety mirror on a toy.",1,163
"great, but wish it had an arm segment: i can get a nice workout from this dvd and have a good burn the next day. very easy to follow the main and modified workouts. i wish it had an arm segment to complete it, though. i tend not to grab it as much as other exercise dvds that include arms.",1,60
"this book will stay with you for a long time: i read this book years ago but i can still remember it to be one of the best true crime books i have ever read, and i have read alot of them. i often wonder what became of the killers, chuck and marlene. one can only imagine. these two teenagers were definately evil and i can't imagine how they could live with themselves. the author should definately write another book on how these two wound up.",1,86
"an ingenius literary masterpiece: being a legend of 1,086 pages, the lord of the rings is truly the only book one can read and feel like you've stepped off a train which has transported you from tolkiens' world and back into yours. it is by far the longest book i have ever had the amazing pleasure and honor to read. i highly suggest you take part in frodo's adventure with his faithly servant, samwise, in a overly valiant effort to overthrow the dark lord, sauron. it is a tale of triumph and defeat; of death and glory; and of sadness and great joy. if you do not read this book, you will be doing yourself a great injustice.",1,118
excellent quick advice: this book is an excellent reference to bring back a parent who may want to find fault in all your child does.it's an easy read and a good gift for a parent of an up-coming teenager.,1,39

"hypnotic: this tornado documentary is a work of art. the power and destruction of tornadoes is backed by a soundtrack of electronic music that is haunting and beautiful. it is mood-altering. the documentary side of it features facts (and a little bit of poetry) from a few narrators, including neil armstrong. i'm no expert on tornadoes, so i can't judge the accuracy of the facts. the footage of tornadoes dates back all the way to 1928.the most captivating thing about it, though, is that for long stretches of the program, the narrator is silent, with only the ambient music and occasionally sounds from the tornadoes creating the atmosphere to match these stunning images. like listening to tangerine dream, this film is spellbinding enough to put me in a trance.",1,129
passport/bill holder: pleased with lightweight yet quality of product. was the right size to hold passport and paper monies so as not to appear bulky when placed around neck under garments. zippered pockets on the side enabled easy access to compartmentized papers or monies. appreciated the rounded corners.,1,48
"another brilliant work by walter mosley: devil in a blue dress is a outstanding book. i understand where walter mosley was coming from when he wrote this book. my favorite character is easy rawlins. i like easy because of his attitude. easy is about his money; easy is like a real character who would be nice to met. easy comes across a man name dewitt albright who wants to give him money for finding a girl. what happens next is very exciting. walter mosley wrote a excellent book and i would recommend this book to every one who enjoys comedy, drama and action.",1,103

"if you were born under less than 50 stars....: if you were born under a flag with less than 50 stars, then this book will speak to you. while it is set in 1920's illinois, this book resonates perhaps 50 years into the future, and into the past. alas, i fear that it may resonate very faintly in these ""post-modern"" times. still, if your life is rooted in that golden-age of small-town, heartland america, you will recognise these scenes, these characters, these feelings. bradbury is a writer, a poet actually, of the heart and of feelings. indeed, before i read him i didn't have the understanding or the patience to read poetry. afterwards i did. he opened me up to subtle things.when i see people critisizing his style as rambling or flowery, i can see that they just don't get it. perhaps it is true that in the latter days children will be born without souls....by the way, if you ever pass through green town, i'll be the one at the end of the drug store counter ordering a dish of lime-vanilla ice",1,183
"a lucky find: for halloween in 2011 i wanted very much to play the role of ""tallahassee"" from zombieland. most of the costume was easy to come by, but when it came to the gun it's amazing how difficult it was to find a toy gun that would suffice. thank goodness for this ""little beauty"" of a shotgun. it isn't exact, but it did just what i needed! buy one with pride and happy zombie huntin'.",1,76
delphi xm reciever car adapter: this is about a skyfi delphi unit and is a older model. i bought it with a home kit to use it on my home stereo. i just bought a new truck and wanted to be able to take it on the road. i can't find the car adapter in stores anymore. i'm glad someone had one for sale at amazon. unit works great i didn't have to buy another reciever,1,76

"great tasting, organic tomatoes delivered to the front door: what's not to like? price is at/below local supermarket and amazon delivers the case right to the door. use muir glen exclusively (esp. since it's available from amazon). their foods taste fresh and the addition of the garlic (although quite light) is a nice touch. a winner.",1,56
nexstar rocks!: this has to be one of the nicest enclosures on the market today. i have bought many enclosures in the past but this one by far is the best. the case feels very strong and with a satin finish. i've bought 2 of the nexstar sata enclosures and 1 of the 3.5 ide drive enclosures as well. my best friend after checking out the product bought one also because of the quality.,1,74
"just the ticket: to keep this brief, the static is about the only problem with this product but i found that if you try enough frequencies and mount the tunecast as high as possible in your vehcile, you will be fine. the static on mine is only slightly more noticeable than the static i have on my radio and, for me, that is more than passable.",1,66

"kent ""blah"" is an ignoramous: this schmuk thinks that slayer is a talentless band, i personally am far more into the melodic hardcore scene than any other form of hard music, but to say that kerry kings sucks as a guitarist is by far the most uninformed ignorant dumb@$$ed comment ive ever heard. what are u going to say next zakk wylde is the worst guitarist in metal. but as for the album i think it is the best hardcore album of 2004.",1,83

so happy to find: i had a thermometer like this several years ago and it broke. i have been looking for one all over my small town and also several stores in indianapolis and couldn't find one. i have had to use several cheap tube like thermometers. (they break so easily.) i was so thrilled to find one and i ordered it. it came so quickly and was packed so well. i was extrememly satisfied.,1,75
"tempest review: very true to the original play and without any of the fancy special effects that some directors like to rely on. excellent actors. the characterization of ariel was exceptionally good. costumes tended to be a bit exaggerated, but true to the time period fashions. the director took quite a bit of liberty in the first scene between stefano, trinculo, and caliban, lending it a lot of semi-awkward sexual innuendo that tends to either make the audience laugh their heads off or squirm in their seats. other than that, there is little to nothing of the play's content that might offend an audience.",1,104

"works great, but not hot enough: these are great, but tend to cool down too fast. when skiing or snowboarding it is very cold outside, and taking off the glove to ""refresh"" (shake and expose to air) the warmer isn't easy. moreover, this ""refreshing"" doesn't keep it warm for long enough. i think that these warmers are a must-have when skiing or boarding, and should be in everyone's gloves, but note that although your hands won't be cold, they also won't be warm. cheers.",1,84
"good case that meets my need: i want a case as small as possible for mobility, and this is the smallest case i can find. i don't need space for batteries and memory cards. i usually charge the batteries full before i go on a day trip so there is no need for battery space. the fully charged batteries last well over a day even with some video clips. secondly with memory card so cheap nowdays i don't need to carry extra cards with me unless i want to shoot tons of video. i got a 2gb high speed card for around $40. a 4gb can be ordered for around $90. in fact i wish it could be smaller by eliminating the space for accessories so it wouldn't look fat while it is on a belt. i got a tamrac 5693 digital 3 earlier. but i like this one better.",1,150

"newcastle wa customer: i found this to be a sturdy and convenient recharger for those times i don't have access to a usb connection (like in a hotel room). it also charges the unit much faster than the usb does. it is a little bulky, thus the 4 stars. it would be nice if it were smaller.",1,57
"one of the best cookbooks ever!: this is one of my favorite cookbooks, which i've used for about 20 years. in fact, i used it so much that it was falling apart so i ordered a new one for myself, and then one for a friend as a gift.what i like so much: it's arranged as complete meals, usually 2-3 recipes per meal. then there are directions for what order to do things in, so everything gets done at about the same time. mostly very healthy recipes, with calorie counts. and in addition to all that, every meal either takes less than 30 minutes, or you can make it ahead and freeze it.marian burros rocks!",1,115

"marvelously mystical: the donovan legacy is a great read. i actually own each book separately and i've reread them so many times they are almost falling apart, so i was thrilled with this new 3-in-1 edition. i love the way nora roberts develops her characters, they are people you can care about. i love the touch of fantasy and the humor. i've yet to be disappointed by nora roberts.",1,69
merrell shoes: this is the second pair of shoes i purchased of this same style. they are the most comfortable and casual shoe ever.,1,24
"good value vac: even after reading great reviews of this vacuum we were surprised how much we liked it: amply powered, with a decent sized dirt cavity, the low price is pretty unbelievable. all in all it's a great deal but i have two complaints: i would have preferred a brush attachment on the little hose end but the real disappointment is the non retractable cord. it has to be wound up to store then unwound to use every time and that's a time gobbling design flaw.",1,87
best wok ever: i am so glad i bought this wok. it's the best one i owed ever. it is very easy to clean and i can throw it into the dishwasher. food isn't sticking and i like the little red dot that tells you the wok is hot. i will never use another wok again. just make sure to use silicon stirring spoons on it or you will scratch the nonstick coating. love it.,1,75

(how embarrassing!) on the second run through the house, we never needed to empty it a single time. talk about suction!! even our high traffic areas are fluffy again!better yet, it was easier to push than my old vacuum. the center of gravity on the dyson is lower than your average upright, so it's not constantly tipping over the way my old one did. the extra long cord allowed me to reach the entire house from one central outlet. assembly was quick and easy, and i love that most of the tubing is removable and washable. way to go dyson!",1,158

"the man behind the garden...: this book includes color photographs of the current gardens at monticello and black & white reproductions of thomas jefferson's own sketched plans for the gardens. there is an annotated list of the flowers and ""woody ornamentals,"" such as roses and shrubs, grown by jefferson. there are many excerpts from his writing and letters which give the reader a greater sense of jefferson's broad intellect and love of nature as it relates to his gardens. i was hoping to find a list of flowers native to virginia cultivated by jefferson but, while the origins of many of the flowers are indicated, there is no separate list of the native plants as i had hoped.",1,118

just what i needed at the office: i wanted to cut down on the amount of coffee i drank and realized one of the main reasons why i top-off is because it cooled down. once i got my mug warmer i can now happily sip my cup of coffee throughout the day and it keeps it at just the right temperature. not blazingly hot but just under that. i've been using it 5 days a week 10 hours a day for 2 months and it has been a solid performer.,1,90

works within a heart: this book can enter into the hardest of hearts with its pictures. its simple message shows what the results are of holding a grudge.i have used it within a prison and it was able to provoke good discussion. an adult book disguised as a children's book.,1,50
"lipatti the maestro: ever since these two concerti were first recorded, i have considered them to be the ultimate expression of these pieces. the grieg has never been surpassed by anyone in my opinion. while one might quibble about the interpretation of the schumann, it stands well above any other competition.",1,51
tomtom go 720: i bought this 720 to replace a 720 that kept falling off the dash board of my truck. the last fall broke the plug where the power cord connects. i love the 720 and was lost without it so i bought a new one. the only problem i have is the suction cup on the mount. it seems like it only lasts for about a year. of course i leave it in the car with the unit attached all of the time and i have a disc on the dash which the mount connects to. i did have an issue with the maps when i first hooked the unit to my pc. i made the seller aware of the issue and they stayed in touch until the problem was resolved. tomtom actually resolved the issue for me with very little trouble. i actually think my issue was my fault due to already having a 720 set up on my pc. but within a week or two i had my 720 up and running with no further issues. i would recommend the 720 to anyone.,1,187
"great finale for jack ryan.: i think this would be the pinnacle of jack ryan's career. i don't think you can top being the chief executive of the country.despite the number of pages, the classic clancy thrill is there to keep you reading it. reading this (again) post 9/11 and the iraq invasion gives me the impression the the current job holder wants to be a jack ryan (not).the pace is there. clancy's attention to details is there too.however, for me, the hunt for red october would still be my 5 star clancy book.",1,94
"very good resource: i used this as text for a small group bible study for pre-teens. the participants responded very positively to the encouraging and self-concept building message. in a culture which focuses on the ""outward man"" and robs youth of self-confidence, it is a blessing to have a guide which teaches today's youth that god looks inside and that each of them can be mighty, victorious, and successful! this book would also make a fine family devotional guide as well as in small groups. though it is targeted at youth, adults will learn and grow by internalizing the concepts of overcoming ""grasshopper mentality"". you won't be disappointed.",1,108
"no problems!: i upgraded my graphics card and needed a new power supply to go with it, checked this out and its working perfectly! the installation was incredibly easy, it's dimensions were exactly the same as my old 250w power supply so it fit perfectly into position. took about 15 minutes total to remove old psu and install the new unit. the fan is incredibly silent, i got the power i need, all is well and i am content!!",1,79

"heavenly voice with no equal.: hayley westenra's new album ""pure"" will affect you deeply if you like uncommonly pleasant singing. it's a ""stealth"" voice, to be sure, in that it sneaks in sweetly and harmlessly enough, but by album's end you find yourself wondering what just happened. you'll scratch your head and ask, ""did i just experience the finest human voice in all the world?"" then you'll look in the mirror and notice a goofy ear-to-ear smile on your face that tells everything.so let's just get it out in the open: hayley westenra has the most heavenly, ravishing, soothing and uplifting voice in the universe and ""pure"" will almost make you forget about norah, barbra and celine.as obscure as she is in the usa today, word of mouth about ""pure"" will eventually elevate hayley to a dominant place among popular music artists. get in on the magic today!",1,148

(from the back cover)this movie has decent acting and a pretty good plot. you know almost immediately that the main character, who thinks he is running he show, is being double-crossed. what you don't know is who or how many people are setting him up for the fall. i must say the kind of surprise ending is very satisfying.",1,139

"rankin & bass do king kong: just as rankin & bass had tackled tolkien before jackson did, they also did a king kong movie. once again we have a remote island where kong lives. he also meets a blonde beauty and falls in love. but this version has more. we have an evil villain who has constructed a giant robot kong to aid him in his schemes. but the villain, dr. hu, discovers that the real kong would work even better.now add some gorilla mind control, suitmation, miniature sets, and titanic battles between giants and you get an unforgettable epic (even if you want to forget it). the result is a film that fits somewhere between the original and a godzilla film. visually speaking the film is pure godzilla-style and a credit to the kaiju films of its day. while not as polished as some modern kaiju films no kaiju library should be without one. the dubbed dialogue actually adds to some of the fun as the villain gloats and compares the two kongs. check it out.",1,177

"my first understanding of what racism is: this is one of my favorite tv movies of the seventies which is about racism in the south. the performances of the two lead actors are excellent. patty duke won a richly deserved emmy award for her role showing that her oscar for the 'miracle worker' was not just a fluke. al freeman jr. should of have won as well but that's hollywood. this film opened my eyes to the real world showing me how ignorant people can really be. unfortunately, things have not changed much since its release, however, it's still a great film to watch and analyze!",1,106
fabulous: this is my favorite show and without a doubt the most interesting one i've ever seen. i loved the chemistry between michael and nikita and so incredibly dissapointed when it was taken off the air. i wish people wouldn't compare it to alias because alias is nothing more than silly knock-off. watch the real thing!,1,56

best i've ever bought!: i love this opener without reservation ! i have arthritis in my hands and it's a breeze to use for me. as nothing on the opener touches the food it stays clean which was a big issue for me. i didn't like having to use two different openers for my dog food and people food or having to wash openers your not suppose to wash. the little jaws on the side to grasp and pull off the top is ingenious and works very easily. since it separates the lid from the can by what looks like releasing the glue i've never noticed any debris or shavings of any sort in the food. i will never use any other opener as long as these are on the market as the quality is also excellent.,1,137

"the great mock orange soars to new musical heights: this is definitely a 5 star disc. mock orange has been my favorite band since i first heard 9s and 6s for their creativity/originality and musical talent. this album is in every way better than both 9s and 6s and the record play, and it is not hard to say that. i would have to give the first two discs 4 stars. mind is not brain is by far the most mature and well rounded of the three, their best to date and the best rock out there today. it's just plain cutting edge. the sound is new and original, the songs are more complete and the singing is right on. the great mock orange will finally get the respect they deserve for this masterpiece of music. if there is another band with this sound, i would love to know. it's time for emo to get funky.i am in love with this cd, get it and tell all your friends to get it.",1,172

the contender: the contender i would recommend this novel because it is really good there is and it is somewhat short. in it there is this guy and his friend james and he breaks into this store and he gets caught and he goes to jail. then the people that were with james found alfred because they thought he told on them but he didn't then he ran into donatelli gym and taught him to box. i liked this book i really think you might like it too.,1,88
"the book is good, but not the best of cooper's other books.: this book is the second must for the dark is rising sequence, only because it explains who the drew trio are and who great-uncle merry is. otherwise the book is boring and does not have the action of her other thrilling books. cooper follows my same pattern of writing. she has to warm up her writing skills and then she gets really good with her books. i don't want to discourage anyone from reading the book, though.",1,89

(imagine 200 soldiers and sailors living for months inside a space the size of a mid sized american house). overall a very good read.",1,99

"great lightweight, safe hose: first of all, i love the light weight of this hose. i have chronic pain, and used to dread watering my garden and hosing off the patio. there's nothing worse than a large heavy hose filled with water that gets stuck or kinked when you're already hurting! it's light weight makes it easy to move to other locations, and it's non-toxic, so i can sneak a drink for me and my dragons out of it, too!",1,80
"great idea in theory: this works pretty well. my son was chewing chunks of wood out of the side rails of his crib, so we bought this. there's not enough to cover both side rails, but he seems to only like to chew one side anyways. he hasn't chewed any more chunks of wood since putting this on and he seems content to chew on this instead. the only negative about this product is that the adhesive is not holding one of the ends down. i let it set for over 8 hours, so that's not the problem. it's only in one section, though. fortunately, it isn't making it so my son's pulling it all the way off, so i'm overall pleased with this purchase.",1,125
"great recording, then, now, and always: i don't remember the ,70s; i wasn't even alive then. gram parsons was dead before i was born, but, thanks to this recording, i've had the opportunity to listen to the golden voice that is still vibrant with life. this is an outstanding country-rock recording, and it's great to have (it bears repeated listenings very well). i would have never have stumbled on it, but my uncle, knowing my musical tastes (which include dwight yoakam, lucinda williams, and bob dylan), guessed that i would like it, and he was right. now, i'm guessing that if you like great music, you'll love this album too. buy it today, and help keep the tradition alive!",1,119
"magnificant!: ""vector prime"" is the first book in the star wars novels i've read. i picked it up at a book store, planning only to read it until the books i ordered arrived, but i got into the story so much i've gotten addicted to the series, i've ordered two more. ""vector prime"" is wonderfully written and has action after action. it has fallowed up on the characters very well and has given us the chance to witness, possiblely the down fall of our beloved characters. the introduction of the yuuzhan vong gives our heros a worthy villan. plus, the writer adds something to the story that will change the lives of our hero's forever.if you haven't read this book, read it, if you have read this book, read it again!",1,131
"a definite bargain: the recordings are obviously not the greatest on the market - tennstedt certainly can't match karajan's version of the 5th. the 2nd is a little disappointing, i agree - this is my favourite of the lot, and gilbert kaplan's recording of this with the lso is fairly earth-shattering. notwithstanding, for the amazing price, this set is an excellent buy, and the playing is of a sufficiently high standard to please all but the most critical listeners. unless you want to spend another $100, take this opportunity.",1,89
"a brilliant effort: mike peters, ex-lead singer of the welsh group the alarm, has delivered a superb solo album. though many americans don't realize it's his third since his departure from the alarm in 1991, listeners will love his work. expect to see additional works from peters as he teams with ex-cult guitarist billy duffy to form coloursound. this new project expects to release an album in early 1999.",1,69
"keeping the trend going: tooth and nail and its associate labels continue to make great leaps in the quality and variety of acts they are signing. the x series of cds and dvds could be considered those labels' greatest hits from the last recording year, with a few dips into earlier seasons. most of the tracks on this dvd are more christian inspired rock than outright praise and worship; but there are some real gems of his wisdom throughout. some of the tracks are making headway on the secular scene like thousand foot krutch's ""move"" that was used on espn. overall a tight effort. if you are already into christian rock/hard-rock/hip-hop/metal, this is a must-add to your collection. if you want a good sample of where christian rock is going these days, this will give you a chance to find bands that suit your taste. in short, this dvd rocks. buy it.",1,152
"good bike rack: i bought this bike rack a couple weeks ago. it came fast and appeared easy to install. the one thing i did not notice when i ordered is that the maximum height is 9'6"". my garage is unfortunately about 10' making this unusable until i made it to home depot and got two concrete blocks that are about 4"" thick each for ~$2. now the stand is up (very easy to install) and holding two bikes. the only reason i didn't give this 5 stars is that i wouldn't want to bump the stand too hard with the bikes on it, it's a little shaky!overall i recommend for a cheap way to store bikes and save some space.",1,121
"lyle is in his own orbit: there is not a second of disappointment on this album. are we in texas or chicago? the string work on"" can't resist it"" is unreal! where has francine reed (wild women don't get the blues) been all my life. lot of work behind these cuts, and it's worth every minute of it for us listeners. lyle's only category is excellence!",1,66
"a recommendation for kelly kline from coplay, pa: hi kelly: you wrote that this book didn't have a solution for grass stains, so i thought of you when i saw linda cobb's other book called ""a queen for all seasons: a year of tips, tricks, and picks for a cleaner house and a more organized life!""in this book it states the following: (just one of the things in this book.)spring: garden the natural way...allergy-proof your home...banish grass stains...color your easter eggs....so....i thought you might like to get this book to help with some of those grass stains we all know kids are very good at getting ground into clothes. you didn't have your email address so i could write you......so i hope you see this recommendation.",1,126
"love it!: a delightful, light and pleasant tea with wonderful health benefits. we originally purchased because we heard it was a natural aid for breathing difficulties and sinus problems but grew accustomed to the flavor and drink it regularly. my husband adds raw honey to his tea and after drinking will eat some of the seeds in the tea bag, too.",1,61
tv ears stero: great product! i use these in our travel trailer after my husband goes to bed. so now i can hear the tv without distrubing his sleep and can have the tv as loud as i want it. also it is comfortable on my head!!! easy to use!!!!!,1,50
"complex and meditative beauty: this cd is one of the jewels in my piano music collection. i guess if i had to compare it to something i'd have to say it is vaguely similar to debussy's more dreamish works for piano, with a milligram of jazz added. sorabji's music style sounds very improvisational, yet it makes coherent sense overall. in my opinion this is the best piece that sorabji ever wrote, don't expect something epic like beethoven's fifth symphony though. here is just the song of the simple, meditative wanderings from a glass half-full of red wine, sitting on top of a moonlit steinway, le jardin parfume is a deep midnight contemplation.",1,112
"jenkins' book is the standards bearer of shuttle reference: this is the best book to date about the shuttle. i refer to it several times per week when i need to answer questions from colleagues, the news media and the public.i also learn something every time i read it. jenkins' fine use of editorial comment, facts, statistics and insider knowledge make it invaluable.i didn't think jenkins could (or needed to) top the second edition of the book, but he did with the third.if you need the facts and more, buy this book!",1,92
"first open heart surgery: the content of this movie was excellent history. the movie itself was rather dark and the words hard to hear. the actual facts that this was the first successful open heart surgery, guided by the genius and courage of the people involved. the fact that it took place in the 1940's and the racial bigotry was painful.",1,61
"great house for any insect: this is the habitat only, (as stated, you must send in the coupon for the insect(s) plus shipping. if you are ordering this for the praying mantis, make sure you order by april, so you can get the egg cases sent to you before they are out of stock). this is well made and easy enough for a 5 year old to get in and out of to take care of the praying mantis. its nice because it has a zipper at the top for smaller opening. it has handles to hang as well. the screen is small enough to allow oxygen in and keeps the insects inside nicely. great for educational learning about nature and other creatures. this can be used over and over again for other purposes as well.",1,136
"wow!: well i must say that jude deveraux's books are some of my favorites. i love her time travel books and will always by them. this one is confusing at times but after a while you get into the swing of things. i cried and laughed at this book. i stayed up all night reading it, it was worth being so tired the next day i couldn't keep my eyes open. buy this book and keep it to read again and again.",1,82
"great family movie: kind of a reverse of ""it's a wonderful life"", a man gets a chance to see what his life would have been like had he done what he originally set out to do, before the lure of fortune and power. john ratzenberg plays the part of an angel sent to help. a very entertaining, and hopeful movie, with a very clear presentation of the gospel.",1,68
"a voice in the wilderness...: a nice little book on values and america. it was nice to read a book that did not have the rabid nonsense of either the ""sky is falling"" liberal intellectual run amok or god-laced preaching right-wing wackos. i didn't agree with all of it, but much of it rang true.",1,55
simply superb erotica blaster: this is the first ever penthouse video i purchased and i am very impressed about it. sunney is at her best. she is just too hot all through. although the other two have done thir magic but sunney is just mind blowing.,1,46
"great album, for those who are stronger than the weak american idol fans: ""scratch the surface"" is a great album. i still like ""blood, sweat, and no tears"" the best but that one is tough to beat. if you want some good rough music try this.... if you want to listen to some weak trash, than watch american idol.",1,59
"use indoor or outdoors: this buggy is so cute, we got it for our niece whos 8months old she absolutely loves her new car. it has a seatbelt for safty reasons which is great when using with smaller children than directed. its being used indoors now and will be taken outside when the weather permits. the smile on her face when you beep that horn is priceless. great toy!",1,69
"outdated sure, but still relevant: this book, published in 1996 and half of which is a directory of shops, was bound to be outdated months after publication much less ten years after, as it is now. hence the four stars instead of five.given that, the first part of the book is crammed with a precis or summary of flusser's recommendations that he has used several hundred pages to expound in his other books ('clothes and the man', 'dressing the man') and makes the book worth the (used) book price.i do not understand others who warn against this book because they think it is not objective enough! this is a book written by flusser so of course you will get his subjective view. had it been written by a committee of tailors, well then, i would expect a more balanced view, but it is not. it is up to the intelligent reader to understand they are getting a product of one man's opinion and then proceed accordingly.",1,166
worth it: these inks actually worked better than the brother brand refills i have bought before at a fraction of the price.,1,22
"just take care of it.: when you use this gun correctly, and take care of it, it will work just great. even the best ones need occasional cleaning and lubricating, and this is no exception. i've found that a small amount of basic oil (wd-40) works great, when used carefully. if you don't mistreat this thing, it'll last forever. i've been using this one for almost a year now, on a daily basis, in huge yard wars. it mean that this thing has literally shot tens of thousands of times, and it's just as reliable as it was when i first purchased it. take it from an expert; this is a very good budget gun. it's reliable, powerful, pretty accurate, and will never jam, for as long as you take good care of it.also, i want to note that when people complain about jamming or accuracy, it's generally due to low quality of the plastic ammo. if you use cheap ammo, any airsoft gun will stop being good. get some good ammo, and this gun will perform admirably. and it's less than 20 bucks.",1,184
"the guardian-: i never write comments but this book is totally worth taking the few minutes out to comment on. it was unlike any nicholas sparks book i have ever read. he is my favorite author so i have read just about every book of his. this one was extremely suspenseful. i didn't want to put it down!! i'd keep telling myself.. one more chapter... one more chapter... o but wait.. one more chapter!!! i highly recommend it. it wasn't much of a tear jerker until the end, and i can't say why it hit home to me because i don't want to spoil it for you other readers. dont hesitate on this purchase... it will be worth your time.",1,120
not a better bluegrass album exists: i was truly amazed at the reality of this dvd audio disk. and my dvd player isn't a dvd audio player. i have never heard better bluegrass on any album and i used to play bluegrass on stage.,1,44
great product: this is a great product. my kids love it because it does not hurt when you put it on the injury or cut. i really recommend it.,1,29
"can't stop listening to it: universal audio is their masterpiece. i've been a fan since peleton and have all their albums, so i think i have a bit of perspective. oddly enough, even though the sound is stripped down from hate, there so much happening sonically in each song that i unearth new sounds every time i listen. universal audio is so good that i can't listen to anything else. it truly bears repeated listening. album of the year, definitely. do yourself a favor and get this immediately. highlights: the city consumes us, sink or swim, bits of bone, girls of valour, keep on breathing, now and forever, come undone. it's all good. i get chills when i listen to it.",1,121
high audio quality: this fiber optic cable allow me to keep high audio fidelity in my studio. i recommend it!!!,1,20
one of the best games for any console ever!: all of the previous reviews have said it more eliquently than i care to right now. the game is simply fantastic!,1,30
"effectiveness and leadership!: a attendee brought this book to my attention at one of my seminars and suggested that i purchase a copy. the copy showed up last night and i read the first six chapters. the authors have a unique writing style that is unlike others. it is not the usual dry textbook material that puts me to sleep. instead, they keep the reader engaged using real world examples and openly discuss the pros and cons of particular approaches. this book is good for those who want one book that explains all of the concepts you need.",1,98
"good coat rack.: i was looking for a basic, inexpensive, non-ugly coat rack. i got what i was looking for. i think that the coat pegs are little too short, but they work fine.",1,34
"easy, fast and reliable: i'm using this card with the netgear mr814 router and i'm very happy with the results. link quality is excellent, and i have not been disconnected once. i don't know how easy it is to configure with other brand routers, but with a netgear router setup is a breeze.",1,53
"the finest love poems in this century!: the cover grabbed me, then i opened the pages. i longed to continue reading and ignored the phone. i read the poems aloud, then read them again. they touched my heart, and i read them to my husband. he read them to me. the author combined surrender with passion, ego with god. my book is marked up with my own thoughts! wonderful!",1,69
expensive but i love them: these cost more than i really wanted to spend on salt and pepper shakers but i love them. they look great in my china cabinet or on my table. i wanted a nice set and i am very happy with these!,1,46
"a good read: don't let the title mislead you, this book is not an instruction manual for creative dying. and don't let the blurb about christian painter mislead you, hilary jackson's art is christian-themed but the story isn't. the art of dying is a mystery, a well-crafted mystery about art and murder.set in the richly described northern california village of steeple hill, author diana killian has put together a book with the elements of a cozy mystery; an innocent observer turned sleuth, a small community of artists, murder without graphic scenes of violence, and yep, even a cat - and the elements of romantic suspense; an attractive british man with amnesia, a kind-hearted young woman who cares for him, a dead scotland yard inspector, lingering doubts about altruism or love, and the question of being mislead by someone who may be a victim or a villain. the pieces all fit together smoothly in a good puzzler.",1,156
somewhere in time: this item was exactly what i had been looking for. it was quickly mailed to me and arrived in excellent condition. this is a keeper for my collection.,1,31
"a brilliant and majestic finish to the kings of black metal: this album is simply amazing. the production is fabulous and the instruments sound better than ever. i guess you could call this a concept album, since it seems like the songs lyrics run into eachother as a whole. i first got this about a month after it came out. i had already gotten anthems..., ix equilibrium, and in the nightside eclipse, so i knew i had to get this. i got it, put it in my cd player, and i was absolutely blown away by it. when ""the eruption"" first came on, i was amazed. the guitar playing is excellent. the lyrics, the vocals, everything is brilliant. the lyrics really deserve an applause. they are brilliant. not many other bands write this damn good. i am glad i bought this. it has opened my eyes to a bigger world of black metal, unlike cradle of crap. thanks guys for giving us this. i wish you all good luck and godspeed, and maybe one day, one day emperor will flourish once more. until then, farewell...",1,185
"very interesting: i found this book interesting as it brought me into a world that existed for a young girl in 1925. it's well written and not too taxing. if one is interested in how to write about themselves it's a great tool. (although it doesn't give directions, it shows by example).",1,52
"my favorite pasta recipe book: i love this book! i learned to cook pasta from my husband's italian mother and grandmother and i thought i was doing well, but this book has refined and simplified my pasta dishes. the book is easy to read and easy to use with step-by-step directions. after making one of the tomato based sauces, my husband said it was the best he'd ever had! there are recipes for every type of pasta, too, using seafood (my favorite), herbs and oils, and cheese. fresh pasta, store bought, how to cook it...whether you've been cooking pasta all your life or just learning how this book is perfect. the pictures alone make it worth while. i, also, purchased the author's ultimate bread book and love it as much as this one.",1,133
"when its great they take it away: i absolutely love this product, never had long fingernailsand using this i do. of course now it can't be found.my sister is having the same luck with the product. whyoh why is it gone.unhappy in kansas",1,43
"awesome kitchen!: i bought this kitchen at a garage sale for $20. it was missing the baskets, and the accessories but i was able to purchase them from step 2 for under $30. what a great find! i am still so excited about this! my kids love it and me and my little newborn were invited to a dinner party they put on this evening using this set!they have so much room to play and the area where the dishes can be placed in the middle is their favorite. it was so fun watching my son take the pretend spout and clean the sink that was ""really dirty"" lol. my kiddos are 3 year old boy girl twins and this has to be one of their all time favorite toys!",1,130
another winner: i am a huge fan of mhc. i have to say this is one of her best. not too many characters to keep track of. she has a tendency to do that. which is a weakness of hers.this was very suspenseful. i had a hard time putting it down. no lags in this story. i love the fact that she gets her point across without the profanity that some authors think they have to have.i will keep her on my must read list.,1,85
"awakenings: a true story about desparate research into a tragic medical condition, brought to life beautifully. sad, but thought provoking, it stays with you long after the movie is over. watch it with a box of kleenex.",1,37
complete understanding: this book has changed our marriage for the better 180 degrees and we felt it was our marriage was not too bad to begin with. you need to get past the constant referal to needs not being met and focus on the needs your spouse has and work to meet them. the work book that goes with the book was the real valuable tool that made this book so wonderful. together with a dynamic marriage class we are changed much for the better!!,1,85
"absorbing: reading this reminded me a little of murakami's the windup bird chronicles in terms of the surrealism. there was a time when people were made of paper. a boy's cat is butchered and the grieving boy revivifies his cat by making paper organs and becomes the world's first origami surgeon. a woman is made of paper while her creature is left with multiple paper cuts all over his hands. a baby nostradamus is born. a man loses his lime eating wife because he can't stop wetting the bed, and decides to travel to america with his daughter who attracts the attention of a carnation picker. it's a story of lost love, of planetary wars, the struggle for free will and ethnic issues.certain chapters are told in columns which, to me, adds to the experience.this is not a book for everyone, and i would hesitate to recommend it to anyone who doesn't already appreciate bizarre stories.",1,156
"at last!!!: it's been a long wait, but it's been worth it. there hasn't been a really good literal tranlation on a character by character basis for a very long time, and not only does this book give us that at long last, but it also gives us an excellent english translation that captures the spirit and meaning of this most enigmatic of scriptures as well as the best out there. as the author says, this is only one possible translation, but then he procedes to give us the complete text in chinese with all the varied possible english equivalents so we can proceed to make our own translation or come to terms with the full depth and range of meaning as never before.the lengthy chapter disecting the meaning and possible translations of the first verse, the kernal of the entire work, is worth the price of the whole volume. i only wish the author had done the same with all the verses!if i had to buy only one version of the venerable tao te ching, this would have to be it!",1,182
"take it to the beach! (or perhaps the river?): if you like adventure travel books and aren't interested in reading the fifteen thousandth book about mt. everest (enough already!), then you've got to read this book. a real winner. when's the movie?",1,42
"remaster 2012 ! gotta have it!: so, i've been waiting for the mono issue of this album for a long time. if nothing else, you gotta hear ""we'll run away"" in mono with its much fuller sound. mono is what brian heard and the stereo was done by engineers. the music and vocals are very clean on this cd. the gatefold packaging is a bit weak without any details on the songs but still an overwhelming experience for anyone who enjoys surf music.",1,83
"classic!: omg i dig this movie alot, it's up there with scarface or american gangster. this movie, shows the story of how drugs, money and power can corrupt. this is also one of the first black gangster films, it's well done, acting is on point. wesley snipe is my favorite, he steal the show in my opinion.",1,57
"fast read: was eager to read this book and it was a very good read. couldn't wait to get to the end. won't tell you too much about it, except to say you will probably like it very much...",1,39
"running strong: i got this machine in 2009 from amazon. i use it almost weekly, so far no issues to date. love it and glad i got it. it is limited on space, but what do you expect with a half sized counter top d/w. i have been in quite a lot if you move the utensil tray to a corner you can fit more and don't be afraid to stack on top of things.",1,75
"does the job for a very good price!: i have a lot of dental work, and i've used a lot of ""water jets"" in my life. they generally last only a year or two. so far, this one is the best yet. it's heavy, so it doesn't ""walk"" when being used. it has a lot of water power (keep it low!). the water reservoir holds more than enough for several trips inside the mouth. highly recommended.",1,76
"great pump!!: after my first pump broke 2 days after i got home from the hospital, i ordered this one. i pump 4 -6 times a day and this pump is still going strong! six weeks in i think it is great for the price. i would have paid more!",1,50

"disappointed... i thought ""n"" routers were beter than ""g""??: i jumped on this router during the ""cyber monday"" deals in order to upgrade from a ""g"" router.. my criticism resides in comparison with my 5yr old linksys wrt54gs2 and its comparative coverage as well as difficulty getting me/my wife smart phones to link to it's wifi signal - it says it's linked but the web/streams just won't work. the only positive i can give it so far is our laptop shows 50+ mb/sec., but if i can't get our phones to work i will have no choice but to go back to the linksys for now and possibly return this one.. disappointed. i had planned to dd-wrt the old one and use it as a wirless adapter for my plasma/blueray.. obviously that is on hold.from my experience the old adage applies here, too good to be true :(edit; got the phone issue fixed and has served us well for months w/ no problems - changed the rating to 4 stars to reflect this..",1,173
"down to earth: i have been looking for a good murder mystery series so i am now a new mckevett fan. savannah reid is a character i can relate to with her love of food, cats, romance novels and godiva chocolates. i was really hoping though that she would have caught the killer instead of stumbing into the killer, but that made it all more suspenseful.",1,66
"classic high-price look, for a reasonable price.: gifting this watch to my stepdad. wanted to find him something that could act a dress watch, but be worn everyday. i spent a long time searching the site for something simple, with a date wheel, and with a thin case diameter. i'm so pleased with how slim and light-weight this bulova is. my stepdad likes something large and visibe, but not heavy or bulky. basic strap can be easily replaced when it's worn out.i like to buy watches from amazon because i know i get a good price and that they'll help me out long term should anything go wrong.waited til the price of the watch dropped. really happy with it!",1,119
"just what i ordered.: this was a great gift, my son-in law will enjoy watching it, thank you amazon for making my christmas shopping easier.",1,25
very helpful.: i recently moved to a new home. i had to redo all of my electrical wires attached to the power strips. these cable ties were easy to use and made a tangle of wires into a somewhat neat and organized system. i used id tags for keys (from amazon) to identify which bundle of cord belonged to which electronic item.,1,62
"well made bib.: this is a quality bib. i would have given it five stars, except that it could be improved by changing the strap that goes around your neck. if you put much in the bib, the nylon strap rubs and cuts into the back of your neck. a shirt collar helps, but i often work in a t-shirt. if they made a padded section around the neck, i'd give it five stars.",1,74
"yoga mat bag: i attend yoga every chance i have. i have to say that i love this mat bag! it was able to accommodate my large jade mat easily, and the mat itself does not ""stick"" to the bag. the zippered pocket on the outside of the bag is an extra bonus.",1,53
"right tool for the job: after using this drill at work (i'm a telecommunications technician), i had no choice but to buy it for my new house. this drill is perfect for all the little things like putting on faceplates, drilling in screws/bolts in hard to reach places. it even can do a decent job at drilling in wood screws into studs. all in all, this is really good product and i recommend it for anyone who owns a home.",1,80
"as warm and colorful as the author's garden: very affectionate as memoirs go, as the author's appreciation of san miguel grows with the passage of 15 years. we see nervous visitors develop increasing resourcefulness as they become contented residents, while they introduce us to a parade of beguiling acquaintances. familiar ground to those who love mexico already, a worthy introduction for others curious why we do.",1,66

"a sharp knife is a safe knife.: bought this a gift for my dad, and he has been kind enough to let me use it. this knife sharpener is great. used to use a honing stone - results were excellent but very time consuming. this sharpens everything i have tried (pocket knife, kitchen knifes, outdoor knives) in a few minutes.it is true that a sharp knife is safer than a dull one, but only if you are expecting it! warn your friends if they borrow your freshly sharpened knife!",1,89
"great book!!: this book was extremely well written! ann m martin really went into detail and description about the setting and about stacey's feelings of love towards her student math teacher wes. if you're in middle school and are crushing on someone, you can truly relate to stacey.",1,48

"pittsburgh's chiller theatre original theme: i purchased this album specifically for the first cut. this song, experiment in terror, written by henry mancini and performed by al ciaola was used by as the theme song for pittsburgh's saturday night ""chiller theatre"" on wiic channel 11 for many, many years. i have fond memories of the show and ""chilly billy cardille"", the host. i've been looking for this song for thirty years.the other cuts are a quirky collection of songs used in movies, all good, and comprise a great soundtrack for an offbeat evening in the lounge.",1,96
"this is a excellent album: i bought this cd back when it came out in 1998 because i like robbie robertson. initially i didn't think it was that special. but over time, it grew on me. the forth song ""unbound"" is particularly good. the fifth song (sacrifice) is an unusual indian convict rap that works. sometimes i use its lyrics in my daily life (if i have to sacrifice some more...) this must be my favorite robbie robertson album, because i listen to it more than any of his others. if you are a robbie robertson fan you need this cd.except for the day i bought this cd, i have never seen it for sale anywhere. amazon may be the last place left where you can.",1,126

"excellent: basil kirchin works with electirc harpsichord, percussion and a few reeds on abstractions for the industral north. with such a narrow scope, the music remains spare throughout. this is basically variations on one or two themes.which does not make it repetative or boring. the melodies are so light and transparent, this album maintains a pastoral feel throughout. kirchen works enough permutations, both in the writting and arranging, for abstractions...to hold your attention.kirchin worked a lot on 1960s soundtracks. i don't think this album is for a particular movie, but it defiantely has the nuance of 60s film music. the electric harpsichord in particular gives the album that post sgt. pepper barouqe feel everyone was aiming for.kirchin should have worked with the zombies or left banke. that would have matched perfectly.but, trust me. this will more than do.",1,138
mind candy: this is a book that should be in every school and library in the country.every parent should give there child a copy. it is the gift that keeps on givingas we get older and it can offer tremendous insight and wisdom in how to bea success and separate ourselves from the pack.it is a very readable book and can be read 1 chapter at a time. there is no fillerin this book. it's like candy for the mind.joe s.,1,81
"very terse, good for math majors, good coverage overall: this book was a good purchase. although i am not a math professor the math is easy to follow and provides many good examples on how to design filters, couplers, pcb based antennas etc. essential for anyone needing to look under the hood of how to design microstrip circuitry (the math hood anyway).",1,62
"as cute as pictured: our dog selby just loves this toy - he sleeps with it, drops it at our feet for ""fetch"" and uses it to push a tennis ball around. it is very durable - we play tug with it and he hasn't managed to pull off the ear or the tail. we've washed it a couple of times and it still looks great. i would recommend any of the dr. noys plush toys.",1,76
"great kegerator for the price.: i have had this kegerator for about 2 months now and i love it. the beer is cold and really couldn't ask for more. beer started to get foamy but it was my fault for not cleaning the lines, so keep the lines clean. the tower is has little circulation of cold air from the fridge, but don't know if adding a circulation fan would help any? the cooler is not to loud, not any louder than any other fridge. make sure to keep it indoors because it's an indoor kegerator. after all this, i would recommend this kegerator to anyone. bout to pour me a glass or two.",1,114
great for my 1st grade son: these books have been a great solution for having my [kid] read every evening for his school reading log. he enjoys the stories very much and the chapters lengths are minimal. he easily gets a good 10 minutes read each evening with only an occasional difficult word. he enjoys them so much that now i don't even have to remind him that he needs to read a chapter ... i look in to his room at night and he already has the book out! i love that there are so many books in this series - i plan on buying them all for him :) what a great habit of reading he has gotten in to through the magic tree house series!,1,128

"best christmas present i ever gave: my father is hard to buy for. on a hunch, i bought him this cd, as i knew he was thinking about the war a lot. in all honesty, i thought he would play the cd once, and that would be it. at least once a month, my father comments on how much he values this album. he never removes it from his player. it has moved him and, in its own way, i think, provided some sense of peace about a troubled time.",1,90

"a steal: this has been a good year for soundtracks. first ""oh brother..."", now snatch. a great soundtrack should not carry the movie, but the mood, and the eclectic, shall i say, whimsical, nature of this collection really brings out the scenes. even as one listens to the soundtrack alone after seeing the flick, details of the relevant scenes pop up. there is an incredible amount of energy here, and there has to be, to keep up with the disjointed, parallel-plotted movie. this soundtrack has the feel of a road-trip mix made by a friend of diverse musical tastes.",1,99
excellent book: i really enjoyed this book. sometimes romance novels can get a bit sugary and gaggy but this did not. great story line and kept me interested the entire time!,1,31
"best reading instruction book out there!: this book was recommended to me by a friend when my eldest child was 4. she had a great time going through the lessons- and, the biggest surprise of all- so did i! i have no real instinct or patience for teaching, so the fact that everything i was supposed to say, down to how to correct an error, was scripted for me was my saving grace- hallelujah!that same child is now 7, in second grade (after skipping first grade) and is in the top reading group in her class. i can only credit the foundation that this book taught for that success!i'm working with her younger sister now, and she loves it just as much. i even bribed her to eat all her dinner one night by offering to let her have another lesson after we finished. :d our little boy (age 2 1/2) will sit at the table and try to mimic what my current 4-year old is doing. looks like we'll have no trouble getting him started in a year or so as well. :)",1,184

"great book!: since i love to write but am only 14, i read necessary madness (which is written by a young, talented writer) as inspiration. i loved the book. i couldn't put it down and had to re-read parts of it several times because they sounded so beautiful and were so true. it is a very poignant and well-written story about tragedy, love, and relationships but also about hope and getting on with life after losing a loved one.",1,79

"got the first one free, but bought the rest!: i liked the product description, read all the reviews, and still decided to take the leap. i'm glad i did! if you've read the magnus pack series by shelly laurenston and liked it, then i think you'll also like this series.i liked the close-knit family aspect and the do-anything-for-my-mate heroes. no, the series doesn't require a lot of deep thought to read, but it is enjoyable. i finished each book in an afternoon.the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is the language. however, i read laurenston's series and it is covered in language too, so it didn't totally put me off. it just made me cringe a little.this series is a keeper, and i can see myself rereading the books in the future.",1,134

"an amazing purchase: i was so surprised by how cheap this game was. other sellers were selling it for 100 dollars or more while i got it for 14 dollars. the delivery is very fast. it said 1-19th but i got it the very first day. i did think though that i was going to get the pal version of the day, which i actually found out about the day before the day of shipment but what i actually received was the ntsc version. thank you spun!!!!",1,87
"compostumbler 02001: i find this product to be well designed and the components to be of good quality. assembly was straight forward and easy to accomplish. the unit composts well and quickly. i would recommend this composter to everyone interested in composting. the one criticism i have is the door. although functional, it is cumbersome and tough to open without removing the door. i believe a minor redesign of the door hinges would greatly improve the composter.",1,77
"sounds like a roller rink but in a good way: i really like lrd's remix of cassius's song feeling for you and this cd is the same style. it does have eighties style digitized rythm and i think its sneaky for him to pose as a french guy (though maybe thats those badboys at astralwerks) but its a cool disc. you could definitely do worse. also, it is consistent. so if you like a song you heard somewhere by him, you'll like the album.",1,84

great deal for the price.: i bought this grooming kit to replace a broken part (foil micro shaver) from a kit i bought at costco a few years ago. the price for this whole kit was the same as the replacement attachment! now i have plenty of extra parts as the originals wear out.,1,54
"yearning! epic! energy!: great cd, it still has that big-screen feel of their debut. nothing is small on this album. they have a their own sound that makes me think of orchestras. would definitely recommend buying it. am giving 4 stars not 5 because it's not as amazing as their ep. after 'no cars go', nothing on this album quite hits me the same way.",1,65
"collection of hits from 71-72: all original hits. the songs on this cd are all wonderful, considering their breadth of style. song list (since it's not listed):1. brand new key - melanie2. clean up woman - betty wright3. jungle fever - chakachas4. nice to be with you - gallery5. suavecito - malo6. i gotcha - joe tex7. hot rod lincoln - commander cody & lost planet airmen8. oh girl - chi-lites9. how do you do? - mouth & macneal10. rock steady - aretha franklinthis collection of hit songs is especially interesting. humor songs are well represented in hot rod lincoln and i gotcha. funky, danceable numbers are included in rock steady, clean up woman, and the risque jungle fever. oh girl is a classic soul ballad, whereas the soft suavecito has a slight latin flair. brand new key and how do you do could be described as cutesy, whereas nice to be with you is good mainstream pop. many of these songs are otherwise hard to find. i recommend this cd to anyone who likes great early 70s hit songs.",1,180
"a great ending...: a 3 book series that is well worth the read. clever and well written. a little dated but hey, what can you do? anyone interested in the sci-fi fantasy genre should invest in these books. i went to the author's web page and mailed my copies to him, now i have signed copies! hooray for me!",1,59

"metallica is back and badder than ever!: holy hell in a hand bag does this album rock! metallica is back and they mean business. lars ulrich has brought in the big guns with double bass in about every song, and you can literally hear jaymz and kirk pour their hearts out in their monster riffs that flys like fire through their finger tips. oh and minus one bass player? bob rock stepped up and took care of the bass beautifully. this album shows metallica going back to their roots, back to the ""kill em all"" and ""justice"" days when they were heavier than ever. you can't go wrong with the songs such as st. anger, frantic, and invisible kid. they are all so awesome!! if you are a metallica fan then this is the album for you, happy listening metallica friends!",1,141

"canon powershot sd800 is: in addition to taking great pictures - and having optical image stabilization, this camera has a lens which can shoot 28mm wide angle(in 35mm film terms)pictures plus it has an eye level optical finder which makes the camera easier to hold steady and easier to use in bright sunlight. - canon still produces a camera in this series with similar wide angle capability, but the eye level finder has been eliminated on that model has been eliminated - more than 7.1 megapixels in a small sensor camera like this would not not significantly improve the picture quality - and may actually create more noise. yet this camera is less expensive than the newest model. - grab one before they are all gone.",1,126

"the game isn't the problem: i think that the rules in 3rd edition are limited so that yo have to buy all the books. this is especially the case with all of the third edition books gradually coming out. the worst part about this book (3rd ed) is the organization, you can't find anything and the index doesn't help",1,59

"exceptionally well done: the thing about spencer novels is the presentation of the main characters; susan, hawk, and especially spencer are cool. because the books are written from a first person perspective, there is a special opportunity for audio books. burt reynolds takes advantage of that opportunity. his character portrayals are excellent.reynolds delivery is outstanding. he doesn't try too hard. his timing is great. sometimes it's almost like he is talking specifically to me, not to a room of people - like he is responding to my feedback or something! he portrays the characters as i imagined them before i ever listened to a spencer audiobook.

"adventure story in the land of the northern lights: this was a hard book to put down once i'd started. the story has a stranded canadian sailor, john mclennan, as its main character, whose life is saved by the chukchi. during his becoming adapted to their way of life and marrying among them, he finds the english language useful in communicating with and warding off occasional scientific explorers and other adventurers, who find these inhabitants and their land of wrangel island off siberia tempting prey for get-rich schemers. the full range of lean and prosperous seasons in the stark, isolated landscape circa 1910 to 1917 is heartbreaking and joyous in turns. the reader will find plenty of walrus and nerpa and other sea animals and their usefulness to wonder at. the flavor of the this slice of life comes through too from the translator's leaving in some authentic everyday words, whose meaning is immediately appararent from the context or the aid right at the bottom of the page.",1,168

entertainment for the cat and less work for me!: i have three cats and decided to try this automatic litter box. i have one young cat and two older ones. the younger one watched me put it together and set it up. she was quite intrigued by the raking motion. she immediately used it upon final set up. then laid there and waited for the raking to begin. when the raking finished she jumped in again and then jumped out. then she laid there to wait for the raking to begin again. i also bought one for the upstairs and have had no problems with that one either. i am looking forward to less mess and smell. i can see and smell the difference already.,1,125

"a rock revolution: i just flat out have to tell you that this is one of the best and any abb fan must have this to experience the original sounds of this group. the ""early sounds"" are so tight. makes me remember being there in byron. the sound quality of the recording is quite good and brings back the jammin' sounds that made the allman brothers one of the ushers of southern rock. i favor the first day recording over the second, but both are superb. after some 33 years, the sounds are still classic and fresh. how is that? because the allman brothers will remain one of the benchmark bands of rock. favorite songs are elizabeth reed, whipping post, and statesboro blues. whether the brothers wrote it or re-arranged it, the sounds on the festival album are on any real fan's ""must have"" list. buy, i promise you, you will not be disappointed. trust me!!",1,156

"pregnancy + back 'n belly = better sleep: this is my first pregnancy and i was glad i decided to invest in this. sure i still don't sleep the whole night through because of nightly potty breaks but that's pretty much what i wake up for not because a pillow slips out of bed or aching hips. occasionally i'll wake up to turn over, but it so much easier to get comfortable again without adjusting a zillion pillows. i had some trouble with the seam at the top of the pillow at first, but after breaking the pillow in a little it doesn't bother me. i remedied the problem at first by sleeping with the pillow upside down. i thought the purchase was way worth it.",1,126

"great music!: jrb is one of my heroes! he did an awesome job adapting the story of leo frank to music quite fitting of the south while adding his usual jewish tinge to it. i love 'all the wasted time'- one of the best musical theatre duets in the past 50 years, as well as 'this is not over yet'- a tour de force piece of work. pretty much everything in this book is wonderful. it will definitely take either an extremely talented classical pianist and/or a strong reader in chords and feel for the songs to play a lot of these accompaniment parts, but they are some of the most enjoyable songs to play. my only reason i am giving the songbook 4 stars is because it doesn't have 'there is a fount/god this don't make sense' in here. i figured out most of it by ear with the cd, but still it would have been nice to have included this heartfelt eulogy to mary phagan in here. oh well, i guess you can't get them all. buy this book and enjoy!",1,183
if you can do everything on this dvd you have a full performance: this is so cool to watch all the way through -- the lessons are broken up by performances. the dvd definitely warns you when a trick is likely to hit you in the head or face. it makes you obsessed with practicing.,1,55

"the urethra chronicles, vol. ii - great buy: the urethra chronicles, vol. ii is a great investment for the biggest of blink-182 fans that may know everything about mark, tom, & travis, to the fans that may be trying to learn more about them. this dvd includes indepth interviews with mark, tom, & travis, the making of ""the rock show"", ""first date"", & ""stay together for the kids"" music videos. it also includes behind the scenes footage of blink-182 tour life, what goes on backstage, and while in the recording studio, & so much more. my favorite part of the dvd is right before the credits when mark, tom, & travis talk about their friendship and the band to ""what went wrong"". honestly, i would buy this dvd even if that was the only part it had on it. this dvd does have a parental advisory warning on it, but it is mainly for the language in their songs. the urethra chronicles, vol. ii = great buy!",1,167
"wow: adam scott wasn't really on my radar but i caught him in the last season 2 episode of eastbound and down. a couple nights later, ""the vicious kind"" was on one of my cable channels. good god. he has such a delicate face, but with the facial hair, it seemed to help in changing his persona. really good movie and he was smoking hot in it.",1,67
"quick miss spelled word corrector.: i just got mine a few hours ago, so i'll just hit the high points here.1. multifunctional2. cheap!3. it took me one minute to get it going, (with one eye on the instructions and the other on the keyboard.) i got it right the first time.cons:(there are some, but nothing of concern)1. if you were four years old, (skinny fingers) you could use the keyboard like a typewriter. as an adult, if you line up all four of your fingers on both hands--squeeze them together--they are still too big to type on it.--but so what, you knew it was small before you bought it.2. 500,000 words would have been a lot better for me instead of 110,000 words. (getting an update for a couple of bucks, from the company, with another 2 or 3 hundred thousand words- would have been nice. i didn't get it for the games or sat's--i would rather have had the addition words.but did i forget to mention it's cheap!...easy to use!...worth it!?bye!",1,172
"good addition to your movie library: this movie pokes fun at all of the politically correct thinkers. its good mindless fun, but those who expect seriousness should avoid this one!the movie centers around a basic idea: too many people are uptight, and just don't know how to have a good time. this movie is good for laughs and shouldn't offend anyone (unless they want to be offended)i had the tape version, and nabbed the dvd as soon as it came out.heartily recommend it.",1,83

nj tax liens: this book is very informative. the chapter on foreclosure is only something a lawyer has knowledge of. the appendix is great because it contains many of the essential documents needed for tax lien investing. the only thing i thought the book was missing was some more detailed profit calculations/interest accruals on subsequent taxes. a nice walk-through cash flow example would have made this book a 5/5.,1,69

"a great person, a great voice, a great album!: hey, like most of you, i think that lila is also sooo underrated, it's not fair because she is really good. she has an outstanding voice not like most other country singers. i personally know because i have a karaoke system in my house and i pop in cd's every once in a while to sing to when i'm bored. now, i think i have fairly an average voice and man, i can't pull off the songs as good as lila can on this cd, while i think i'm better than shania twain when i sing her songs, because i guess they don't require that much vocal talent and does not have a lot of difficulty. man, i got to give it up for lila for doing so great on all the songs. so yeah, this is a great album with a great variety of songs, from the upbeat dances and ballads, to the inbetweens--it just has it all. want to find some more underrated artists? check out hoku and jennifer love hewitt.",1,182

"breathless: awesome, gorgeous, exquisite, exhilirating...i don't have words. the technical prouesse is nothing short of astonishing: one has to try and imagine the sheer physical difficulty of handling the double bass, the physical effort invoved in playing this most awkward of instruments, its bulk, the weight of its strings, the inertia of the bow. then there's the beauty of the double bass: the volume, the overtones, the basses, the harmonics. and then there's meyer... casals' recordings are a must, and unsurpassed on the cello. what meyer does here is add another dimension, literally: using the bass' limitations, he makes them work for him, for the music, for us and for our enjoyment. this is art of the highest order, beautifully recorded and produced. even if you have casals' recordings, get these. they'll change the way you hear the suites",1,139

"great quality, powerful clipper: i have thick hair, and have been cutting it myself, with store-bought clippers, for years. during a recent use, my clipper choked on the thick hair, and i decided to get a professional clipper, so i bought the oster classic 76.what a difference! as you might expect based on the price, the oster is in a class above when compared to the clipper kits you buy at the local rite-aid or walmart. it's a quality appliance and seems to be well worth the extra expense for regular clipper users.so, why 4 stars instead of 5? two reasons. one, it doesn't come with the numbered plastic combs--you have to purchase them separately. second, it's on the heavy side and it's a bit cumbersome to use compared to the lighter, cheaper models. i suppose that's the price you pay for quality.",1,143
"great film, if you don't think about it: frequency is a movie that entertains, thrills, and stimulates, but all that can be ruined if you think too much about it. dennis quaid plays frank sullivan, a firefighter killed in a fire in 1969. thirty years later, his son, john (played by james caviezel), finds his father's old ham radio. through the miracle of the aurora borealis (how many of those do you see in new york?), they manage to talk to each other through the ages. through this communication, john saves his father's life, but he changes history so that a famous murderer is back on the lam, and he is going to kill john's wife. so far, so good. but soon after, inconsistencies pop up. all in all however, this movie is a fine story that was short-changed in the theatres. i would recommend it to anybody who likes these kind of cross-time magical movies.",1,156
"like all of oates' books, this one is incredibly haunting: this is an incredibly haunting book. it examines the complexinteractions and experiences that go into creating our coreselves.iris courtney grows up in an emotionally impoverished and al-coholic home where chaos looms in the wake of her mother'sdrinking. iris yearns for love and touch but her mother'sdistance causes irrevocable pain, dissociation, and fuge-likestates that become iris's primary coping skills.eary in the book, iris becomes fatefully tied to a young blackman who innocently kills a boy who has been tormenting iris.their lives become forever connected as they maintain the se-cret of the killing forever.",1,102

"praise for international marionettes: i liked the fact the book was written by an ex employee of a major corporation in a manner that related the true feelings that many management employees experience, but do not have the courage to talk about, much less write about. it brings home the job pressures and the need to continually perform and improve. it also clearly outlines what lengths the corporate world will go to to maintain control.the author is to be saluted for having the backbone to fight back and to stand for principle. most of all it is a story of his tenacity and need to persist and to get answers. several of the chapters deal with the author's dark side and indiscretions which add flavor, but cause one to say ""why did he do that?""",1,135
"a compelling read: ann patchett has an amazing way with words - she sculpts characters that are more than 3 dimensional. this is a love story, but is it romantic love, love of life, love of art? all three, i think. i didn't get swept up into this book quite as much as the magician's assistant, but i still recommend it. it is a very unique story, with totally lovable characters. i missed them when i was done reading the book! enjoy!",1,82
"miss wilson never misses: miss wilson is my favorite singer -- there are no exceptions -- so if you're looking for critical words you can stop right here. on this album she puts her unique style and charm to several new tunes (my favorite is ""knitting class"") but most stellar is her version of ""taking a chance on love,"" on which she makes the most of her lower register (which has always been stellar and wonderful). this song, and some others on recent cds, are from the ""old school,"" as if miss wilson finally decided to sing some of the stand-bys, as if clearing up some old ""to do"" lists. we are the beneficiaries. i'm grateful she continues to record, but i miss very much her live performances.",1,128

"cd comes with the best music video madonna has ever done: hi. i gave this single 5 stars, not for the remixes, but for the wonderful music video that comes with it. when she came out with the song i was disapoineted that the video didn't come out on dvd like ""music"" or ""what it feels like for a girl"", but when i slid the cd into my computer (to play the songs) i was pleasently suprised to see the music video pop up! it is so cool to watch madonna dance around in the sand with her cow-girl hat on and cow-boy boots. this is one of her best songs and in my opinion it is her best video. when you put it in your computer it comes up just as clear as a dvd would be. it comes in as a full screen!!!! as far as the remixes go, they are are pretty good. i prefer the original version, but when i found out this cool music video was on the compact disk, i bought it on the spot! you better add this to your wish list... fast!",1,190
peterlor: the previous reveiwer who suggests that this book is being removed and that stephen hawking does not want it published has got it entirely wrong. what he refers to is a completely different book. universe in a nutshell is a new work based on hawking's new theories and the author and illustrators spent two years creating it. i know this because i was responsible for the artwork. it's a pity that so-called reveiwers are so ignorant and loud-mouthed without having the knowledge or intelligence needed to make comment.,1,89

"it is simply the work of a poetic arsonist.: john norum's ""optimus"" is a an incendiary cocktail that burns,without variation, into a symphonious burst of poetic expressions. the guitar work is consistent and pleasantly harsh, from beginning to end and the songs are even more interesting as they are stressed by john's ferocious and turbulent vocals.this album is -required by rule- for people that enjoy his work and it is a great place to start for new listeners interested or curious about his music.""optimum"" creation!",1,85

"purchase depends on scope of aspiration: any person who considers spending an entire day away from work in the kitchen would enjoy this book; as well, anyone who could blow a sunday on the couch reading about food would dig this book. after having trained under a fanatical cia grad, i can attest that the techniques presented seem a parallel representation of this chef's slant. my only gripe is that this book should be all technique, with recipies supporting the ideas only. all in all, worth the discounted price here at amazon. if you have never cooked in a live kitchen but wish you had, study the technique offered in this book and use the recipies as a learning aid.",1,120

""i lied before. i want your mouth too.""i'd forgotten how devastating i found that little phrase. i want. well, it was more than a phrase, after all -- it was, as i could have told you at nine years old, a complete sentence, the verb sweetly agreeing with the subject in number. number? one. just him, his declarative, subjective singularity -- taut, swollen, urgent. i want. tense: the present. oh, yes, very tense, and very present. a simple sentence, wanting to grow, to complexify, its predicate demanding its object --- give it its object. your mouth. and i opened my mouth, and he pulled my head down on him, hard. oh, and i want you. i want you. to want it. to want me. it. dissolve. drown in the ambiguity.--stunningly written, this little bit of cunning linguistics alone is worth a five-star review. it literally took my breath away.thank you, molly!",1,163

"""nbc beijing 2008: opening ceremony"" --: the title should be sufficient clue for those paying attention: it is the nbc presentation of the 2008 beijing olympics opening ceremony. which means it is the presentation one watched (or not) on teevee when nbc originally boradcast it.what stumps me is why those who give it negative reviews expected something other than that it is clearly labeled as being: ""nbc beijing 2008: opening ceremony,"" complete as nbc broadcast it.",1,76
"character fantasy: this review takes the entire trilogy into account. hobb does a fantastic job with the characters in this series. they are all living breathing people. i am not normally one who likes the first person narrative but hobb masters the technique. the magic in this series is original and intreging. book one and two were excellent, the third book drags alittle and the ending left me feeling slightly cheated but over all these three books that any fantasy fan will enjoy.",1,83

"amazing game!: i am not a gamer at all, but my husband got addicted to this game and insisted i try it. it is really a fun game! the programmers who made it must be tops in their field because there are very few glitches or bugs and the game-play is very intuitive. the detail is just amazing - from stars in the sky to footprints on the ground, they haven't left out any little thing. you really become part of this imaginary world.even though a large part of this game involves killing members of the other faction as well as various other computer-generated beasts, this is not a mean-spirited game. it's difficult to be successful unless you team up with others and cooperate. i have seen a lot of very altruistic, helpful, and generous behavior from other players. there are always a few dorks around, too, of course, but for the most part this game seems to bring out the chivalry in its players. i'd recommend this game for age 13 and up.",1,174

"a very complete companion: the greenhouse gardener's companion is a very thorough guide. the order of chapters makes sense - well thought out, and is a pretty darn good read. the author does not seem full of himself. it can be both humorous and thought provoking.",1,46
nice replacement battery: i used this battery to replace the factory installed battery in a mx-950 aurora from universal remote. it fit perfectly and works seamlessly. the charge is holding very well.,1,32
impressive and well done: great movie. a good addition to the bourne collection. i wasn't sure what to expect but i really enjoyed it.,1,24
wow !!!: i love this dvd..hubby bought me for christmas....similar to survivor but muchbetter!!! the scenery was beautiful!! it's amazing to see how peoplesurvive with only the barest essentials and hike through snow....well worththe purchase if you like adventure...i was sad when it ended....i want more!!!,1,46
"great tactical knife: the knife in 4"" version is just right for concealed carry, and it comes razor sharp. the quick open technic when removing from a front pocket is even easier and faster than an illegal switch blade. your going to like this knife! well built, solid with zero play in bolsters. locks up quick and tight. i was impressed, the knife was on sale for $39.00 when i bought it. true value for the quality of the product. i would buy another and recommend to a friend. this was my first cold steel knife. i read the rave reviews first and i concur totally. it's a keeper!",1,109
"brilliant!: i love this band. more than 5 years (since cantoney), but sinn licht was a real shock for me. murky atmospheres, fine female voice, a lot of modern neo-folk tricks and medieval feelings... it's my choice... for now. all the best in neo-folk is coming from germany i think... corvus corax, fiddler's green - and merlons, of course!",1,59
"great machine with a couple of suggestions: the oregon 88-023 does an absolutely beautiful job of grinding blades effortlessly. should have purchased one years ago. i highly recommend it. however, why did they not include a second table plate? the cost would have been negligible. when switching from left-handed to a right-handed blade one must detach this plate and move it to the other side of the grinder. also, braces on the hood as in similar models, would be nice, as it tends to vibrate/oscillate during operation.",1,87
"nice watch for a great price: bought it as a gift. almost kept it. simple but very nice, especially for the price.",1,22
"trotters and pacers: another wonderful book from marguerite henry, this one tells 2 stories in one, which is a very unusual structure for her. i loved this book as a kid and was looking for a new copy. if you look at the images, you'll see the 2 different covers for this book, the original, by wesley dennis, shows a trotter - the new image for the cover, by a different artist, shows a pacer. this gait, while used by standardbred horses, is very different than a trot. that's sort of like putting a football player on the cover of a baseball hitting manual! it's sad that the people who now publish her works don't seem to know what the books are about!luckily the text is still right, and the story still wonderful.",1,133
"blade rules: blade is an awesome movie that is about a half-man half-vampire andhe kills people,awesome movie for you action people!blade 2 continues the trilogy and blade 2 is about blade killing even more people. another great action movie!blade 3 is the one to end it. blade 3 gives us one last reason that the blade series is awesome. best blade as far as action.",1,65
"kampy, klever, sooooo kool: after the first viewing you will say wow! that film was interesting but could have been so much more. this really doesn't matter. after the second viewing you will understand what the filmmakers were going for and how they succeded on every level. it could be remade, but it would probably lose much of its low budget charm and freshness. the cast is only marginally good but it's not a variable. the film plays like a nightmare and is a perfect addition to mgm's midnite movie collection because it is best viewed in the later kult hours. you might just walk away unsure about clowns and their motives. what a fresh concept. thank you chiodo brothers!",1,120
"million dollar consulting toolkit: this is a good book for anyone considering starting a home-based consultancy. i have been cosluting for many years, the last ten or so from a home office. this is not an easy transition and i found the toolkit helpful in many ways.it would have been extremely useful had i had it when i started out many years ago. useful when i made the change to a home office and i found it still full of useful things after 35 years in the business.for the consultant that operates alone this book should be on the reference shelf.(after it has been read of course!)murray harvey",1,108
"worth buying: there are a lot of dumb, goofy girly songs on here, but it has some raw ones too (like ""safety first"")... way better than the rest of the crap on krs.",1,33
just in time: the item came just in time and my grandfather was happy to get them. it was the exact fit as described for the model. thank u.,1,29
"a great start to a alyss in wonderland series: when i heard about this book i thought this is either genius or it could go very wrong and i was so happy that it was genius i absolutely loved the book . alyss is actually a princess from wonderland and redd (the red queen) is her aunt . dont want to go into to much details as it will spoil the story and i hate to do that! it does have some parts with violence so if a child is sensitive to that stuff you might want to read the book first! the first three quarters of the book does jump around from alyss/alice,dodge,hatter madigan,and redd but i did not find it difficult to keep it straight! i could not put this book down and now am getting ready to start book two seeing redd !",1,146
"it&#65533;s in the bag: this book is a must have for handbag connoisseurs and girlie-girls. beginning with the super-chic, boldly colored hot pink cover featuring a louis vuitton damier bag, the book is beautifully illustrated with examples of the full spectrum of 20th century handbags from vintage hermes to kate spade canvas to exotic art pieces. the text is comprehensive and intelligent, highlighting the origins and evolution of the purse, yet it is entertaining as well and never too staid. the book has a sense of humor.readers will learn the history of gucci, hermes, louis vuitton, prada, and coach, and learn about memorable bags such as the kelly bag named for grace kelly. it's a handbag lover's dream book.",1,119
"sibley field guide: i had never seen this book befoer, but was introduced to it by the guide on a bird walk in florida. i find it easier to use than peterson's.",1,32
"one of the best albums ever made.: first and foremost this is an innovative concept. 12 tracks has been portrayed as 12 dances with god(!) and name of the tracks are the name of the places (where the dances with god happens). this is an all instrumental suite from the master of flute, 'jethro tull' frontman ian anderson. the music is top notch, qualitywise comparable to any record produced ever. this a mixture of jethro tull kind of music and western classical with a little touch of indian classical music (in the times of india). basically flute and fully instrumental.if you like jethro tull and/or western classical, you will be liking this. it is definitely the most underrated album on earth and one of the best albums i listened. so buy it to experience somrthing great.",1,136
a fantastic weight loss combination!: i am giving this a double thumbs up for a review because i saw instant results since taking this. i slimmed down just enough in just a few weeks to make a solid impact on people at my 10 year high school reunion. i highly recommend this winning combination.,1,54
"easy to wear all day: i wear knee pads aleast eight hours a day doing metal stud framing.very good pad but...the only thing that bother me, is sometmes the metal rivit will dig in to the side if i'm at a akwared angle and the strap can dig in abit but it's not painful more... anoying.if they last me six month i'll keep useing them",1,65
"very nice tie: this tie was very nice. the image was well printed on the silk, the silk was a nice texture. the packaging could have been improved. it came in a cheap plastic sleeve that did not make for particularly nice presentation, and i didn't have a tie box to put it in, but the product itself brought a smile to my son-in-law, which was the point.",1,68
great toy: the toy is pretty awsome. it is a lot of fun and really cool. the only problem is that the batteries die really fast.,1,26
"spider is very old story!!!!: this version of the movie was refreshing, thank god for c.g.i yes! special effects,it was good to see spidey swinging with agility and stealth, tobey mcguire played his part to perfection his presence was definitely a plus for this movie however kristen dunst as mary jane ooooh please!!!!!! well of course i love william defoe potrayal as the goblin, hey guy why the metal mask??? however he was excellent, this movie was balanced exciting and very true to the comic version, i alway say coversion from book to movie is legal rape!!!, this one was not so bad, it was a very believeble performance and would recommend it to any super hero lover this film make me say spidey any day laterzzzz folks...........",1,128
vhs = 5 stars - dvd = 1 star: this 1991 concert is excellent with the best lineup since the original band (69-71) were all around and making great music. warren haynes makes for an excellent 2nd lead guitar with dickey betts and the band plays many of their classic tunes including extended versions of elizabeth reed and jessica. don't buy the dvd as the editing is awful - but do get the vhs for all the uncut tunes.,1,79
worked for me: being that i have no formal training on computers and changing from windows xp to 7 this book is really helpful. sometimes i have to read it a couple times to follow but eventually i get it. thanks for this book. and love the video coming with it.,1,51
"almost perfect: i'd give it 4.5 stars, if i could.love the slim design - i hardly know i'm wearing it. keeps great time. looks much more expensive than it is.con: no light on the watch face making it hard or impossible to read in the dark.i recommend it for a wonderful ""dress-up"" watch.",1,53
great family movie.: this is a great movie. i purchased it for streaming from amazon. we will surely watch it for many years.,1,23
"can i get a sixth star?: guys, this is the hub. in a world where usb hubs flop around under the desk at the mercy of their own cables, this one is like a piece of machined billet aluminum. you either tape or screw the base to your desk, then slide the hub on. it's now fixed in place. it comes with a mini-usb to usb cable to connect it to your computer. then there are 7 more full-size usb sockets, 3 on one side, four on the other. the blue led ""eye"" is nice but not obtrusive. a lovely metallic jewel in a crowd of junky plastic. spend the extra $10.00 or so and get this one.",1,118
"history of motown: great movie and i learned so much about motown that i was not familiar with. i wasn't a huge motown fan but, after watching this movie, i have a whole new appreciation for the artists of that era.",1,41
"roy schieder at his best: this is the movie that made me start paying attention to roy schieder. playing a mobster on the run, he finds himself in latin america hiding with no money, no comforts and no future. he gets a chance to improve his future by taking on a task that is fraught with danger and pushes his nerves to the limit. great dvd to add to your collection.",1,71
"wonderful multicooker for small family: so far we are pretty satisfied about this purchase, though i don't usu. buy stuff from market place because of the shipping fee. we really like this item, and we use it a lot for shabu shabu, and cooking noodles... it's pretty, neat, well designed, and one of the many wonderful things about this is that you can separate the parts and use them individually, and of course each one is of high quality. i strongly recommend this item, esp. to whoever loves shabu shabu, or huoguo:)",1,92
"fantastic achievement!: most comprehensive book on ambivalent men! it guides a woman to regain her life and looks at the causes for his ambivalent behavior and the reasons why a woman may tolerate such bad behavior from an ambivalent man. the book does not preach, rather, it guides the reader through the process of recognizing patterns and modifying her behavior to empower herself! the book a guide to self-discovery and you will use it as a reference book for life!",1,80
"galatic musical symphony: i first heard the planets when a friend of mine played a sample of mars that he had downloaded from the internet. i then felt the vibrant energy that took me to another place where everything seemed distance, i bought the cd two days later and have never looked back. the planets is a excellent choice and i highly recommended it.",1,64
"the name says it all: joe pernice is definitely one of the best songwriters alive today. yours, mine & ours is another great album in his catalog (could even be the best, although i will see how it stands the test of time). from the first listen, you know you must own this album. the opening track, weakest shade of blue, is reminiscent of many songs joe has penned before, except he is now allowing little rays of happiness creep into his music...and the fun does not end there. as with most of joe's albums, there is not a bad song anywhere to be found and it leaves struggling amature musicians, like myself, wondering how it comes so effortlessly for joe. for fans, you already have this..but for newbies to the pernice world, or anyone else interested in good, pure songrwriting...pick this one up. ultimately this is a really fun sunday drive with the windows down album.",1,157
awesome sandals - a note on sizing: these are as fantastic as everyone says they are. i will say though that the sizing is a little off. i wear a 9 or 9.5 in women's shoes and the large fits perfectly. i tried on an extra large in a store (since that's in line with my normal sizing) and there was a lot of extra space in the back fo the sandal. i'd say you don't need to get xl unless you wear a 10 or above.,1,87

"maybe heavy-duty (?): buyer beware! the description at amazon says ""heavy-duty"". however, the package from rubbermaid does not say heavy-duty, and the gloves feel like they are made of normal thickness material.review update after 3 months use: they are holding up well and i now plan to order 2 more pair. changing my review from 1 star to 4.",1,59
"buffy lives: the switch to upn infused the series with a new look and style that i liked a lot. buffy returns from the grave and starts a compelling and believable relationship with spike (in his best season). the three nerds are the best villians in the series in my mind, they are hilarious. spike interigating them with a boba fett action figure is priceless, as is the millenium falcon painted on the side of their covert ops van (with a horn that plays the star wars theme). buy this season for the brilliant musical episode, ""once more, with feeling"" and stay for the evil willow story arc which ends the season. a must have for all fans and another good starting place for newbies.",1,125
great mom and daughter devotional: my daughter and i are going through this devotional. she is really enjoying it. i have not been able to do them weekly though. i love the prayer time and she loves the dates. we both like the cd.,1,44
"excellent movie: i thought this would be a movie that i would have little intrest in, how wrong i was. i was hooked 15 minutes into and could not stop watching.",1,31
"awesome fps/rpg, deserves a re-release: this game was awesome, definitely mature themed and i really enjoyed it. i did not have too many glitches with the software (running xp) and this deserves to be reprinted and put on the shelf again. the music soundtrack is awesome too, so good i bought one of the cds.",1,55
"excellent, interesting esl resource: in tutoring middle- and high-school students from korea, this workbook is the best i've found for studying english idioms and expressions. each lesson's true, amazing short story presents new idioms in context, then an eight-panel comic strip illustrates the story. discussion questions about the story, a summary dictation, and review exercises work together to guarantee that each idiom is read, heard, written, and spoken by my students.i only wish i could find book 1, because books 2 and 3 are so good!",1,86
"great workbook on neural networks: i like this book very much. this workbook instructs one how to work through the mathematical requirements of neural networks. by doing so the reader gets a good mathematical background of chaining through the mathematics and seeing the internal structure of many networks. this information is valuable if one is interested in programming your own neural networks. the 5-1/2 floppy disk accompanying the workbook is not usable, at least not to me. if you need to learn and work through the mathematics and chart the results of neural networks that is a great book to start with.",1,102
"a school girl crush: this story was so far the best of the conveniently yours series about the bravo family. for years lacey bravo has had a secret love for dr. logan severance, a man who is love with her sister. when lacey's sister marries another man, she goes to logan to offer some chocolate cake and a shoulder.......leads to a hot but brief affair. nine months later logan goes to lacey and asks her to marry him. lacey has taken off to her families cabin where she spends the time sketching, and missing logan. even though she loves logan deeply she says ""no i won't marry a man that is love with my sister."" when lacey gives birth, the baby begins to bring lacey and logan closer together, unwillingly, but irrevocably closer. a story that is emotional, intense and moving.",1,141
"loved it: i bought this for my friend, who is a big fan of easy rawlins. we couldn't find it in any vedio store, so i had to buy it. although we both seen the movie many times, this is one of those movies you have to watch every year, like the wizard of oz. we are waiting for easy rawlins to make another movie from one of his books. this is a must see. chrissy",1,76
"great tool; makes pex installation fast, easy and reliable.: like the combination 3/4, 1/2, 3/8 inch combination pocket crimper, this tool works great. use a large pair of vice grips to close the crimper around the crimp ring connection and the connection is sealed. all of my crimps passed the go/no-go gauge test the first time. my connections were crimped over 12 months ago and have had 190+ degree f water flowing through them ever since with zero leaks...can't say the same for my buddy who opted for plastic compression fittings, but we replaced his with copper crimp rings and he's had no problems since. this tool is small so it works in the tight spaces where a lot of crimps are needed as well as easily stores in a tool box.",1,132
lower abs: hook this pair of babies on a bar in a park and i got my lower ab workout. combine these with wheels and crunches and there is no need to dedicate time at gym for abs,1,38
great for sore/cracked nipples: sore/cracked nipples are very common on breastfeeding moms especially first time moms who doesn't have any clue about latching.1 oz might seems very less but it is good enough. latching will get way better after the first 3-4 weeks and you might not need to use it afterwards. so there is no need to get a 5oz bottle. motherlove herbal nipple cream helped me a lot with soreness. also note that this cream is better used for prevention than cure. so apply it before feeding itself. also remember to air dry.,1,95
potential customer: i like the way everything was there for review and especially all the specifcations of the unit in question. only thing i would add would be how much the actual shipping cost would be. i didn't purchase the equipment because of that.,1,44

"do not settle for substitutes!!: i agree with others who have written don't settle for cheaper substitutes! i bought a non-canon brand backup battery for my canon 20d years ago and it was good as a backup. but i just went on a 2 week vacation trip this year and as my canon battery was getting low, i popped in my backup. to my surprise, it was dead, even after recently getting charged! luckily, i was shooting outside and didn't need the flash, so the canon battery held out once i put it back in. the backup battery doesn't seem to hold a charge now. don't try to save some money and then risk losing some good shots--buy canon! you'll be glad you did.",1,124
"such a great book: this is one of the best books i have read in a long time. it is personal and deep and really makes you think, but is also very funny. i read this for book club and it provided alot of discussion topics.",1,46
very handy: as long as you don't expect this to totally replace your vacuum cleaner i think you will be pleased with this product. it is so handy for those little jobs you really don't want to drag out the vacuum to take care of. i use it daily for the quick pick-ups that seem to pop up. i even find pet hair when i empty it although i have no illusions it pulls up as much as a vacuum. i am totally pleased with it.,1,86
"great perspective shaver: ididn't finish it all yet, there is lot to read from here! really it transforms my perspective and helped me to view what's matter in life and what it is an illusion. reading it is easy and enlighten, now put it all in practice is definitively more challenge, but worth it! i'm not planning in turning into buddhism as a religion but the teaching i recommend them to every one; if you can go to classes near where you live that helps too.i loved it, already gave it to many members of my family and friends!",1,99
"probably the best camera for this price and quite a bit more, too: god, this is a wonderful camera. it's small, it's light, and it's got a genuine wide angle lens. you can still together shots for a 180 degree view, which is truly nifty, and it's got video capability and everything. on mine, however, the lcd screen proved vulnerable for reasons yet to be determined but depending on kodak's response, i'm reserving judgement. these are awfully awfully nice cameras, tiny and high quality. i'd have a hard time getting anything else after this experience, even with the screen self destructing.eta: and the kodak people were just wonderful, the camera was fixed, and i am happy all over again.eta #2: the lenses are both digital, which means the camera's profile is flat all the time. a great advantage.",1,138
this wassup!: you did ya thing on this book girl! i enjoyed the entire story from page one all the way to the end. it's always a blessing to see a first time author come in the game and put it down! this is definitely a book to read.,1,49
"a masterpiece: the principles inside of this book are priceless. utilizing them will drastically improve your legal writing skills, which will ultimately foster success in your legal career/education.",1,28
"metal: cannibal corpse is metal. if you look at death metal and merely think only melodic bands from sweden make up this genre, you are dreadfully wrong. cannibal is a brilliant band. they know exactly how to piss of the mainstream and still sell more records than any other death metal band in history. by the way..my favorite band of all time is death, and of course this is not anythinglike shuldiners music. you see, to be a true fan of metal you must have ears for it all. from cannibal to iced earth, from shadows fall to nevermore, metal is metal. as chuck himself once said, there is no death metal, just metal!!!",1,114
"great music!: all the gaither music is great. if you are looking for good ole southern gospel, the gaither series contains a good compilation. my husband (who btw didn't grow up with southern gospel music) has been particularly impressed with the quality of the sound recording. i highly recommend it!",1,50
"best idea: this steam mop was the best idea bissell came up with. i have three small kids and the steam mop cleans up all the mess in no time at all. it's so easy to use even the kids like to mop the floors. the only complaint i have is that the pads are hard to get on. i have broke a few nails doing this, it would be nice if they came up with an easier way to do this.",1,82
"leaky but fixed: i threw away a $150 cuisinart grind and brew and replaced it with this coffee maker. what i like most was it's large capacity. i drink coffee practically all day, and i always have coffee left in the tank at the end of the day. it also brews quickly. the cuisinart was painfully slow.after over a year of trouble-free operation, the caraffe started to leak, not at the valve, but around the metal disc at the bottom of the tank. i googled hamiltion beach, sent them a nice e-mail, and even though it was outside the warranty period, they shipped me a new caraffe for free, plus $6.95 s&h.;the leak is a common problem, but i'm satisfied with the customer support i received. you can't fill up a travel mug unless you scoot it to the edge of the counter, but i've read they've redesigned it. otherwise, i love this coffe maker.",1,155
"pleased: i have this and the 2000 hawaiian slack key christmas cut. both are fabulous but if you had to choose one, i'd favor the 1996 cut for the sweet, mellow sound... the old style.",1,35
"want to be scared?: thirteen short stories that will make the hair on the back of your neck stand up. author ross p. psuty has given his readers a masterpiece in horror. demented psychopaths who love a fresh kill. i picked up this book because the cover jumped out at me. i was overjoyed when the characters did the same. with a smooth style that will leave you wanting more and more, ross p. psuty should be the next great horror writer. pick up a copy of ""tales of the axe"" and find out why dark country roads will never quiet be the same.",1,104
"a useful concise guide to the theology of the cross: forde's concise book of reflections on the hiedelberg disputation that become the foundation for the lutheran concept of ""theology of the cross"" is a short read that is relatively easy to read, given the complexity of the document that it seeks to unpack (the hiedelberg disputation).in in, forde separates luther's 29 theses into manageable chunks that then form systematic boxes to understand each of the unique points made by each thesis. forde does a good job of structuring his book to allow entry into the complex and often counter intuitive thinking of the theology of the cross.i'd recommend this book to anyone who was seeking to gain entry into understanding the concepts of the theology of the cross, anyone who wanted a refresher course before diving deeper, or anyone who wanted to use it as a devotional guide.",1,148
"essential for all parents of preemies!: when my daughter was born at 27 weeks i bought about 8 books about preemies! this is the only one that i would recommend to other parents. it is easy find answers to specific questions and explains things very clearly. while there is no substitute for getting an explanation directly from your child's neonatologist, the book often gave me enough information to ask better questions and ask about things that may not have been addressed. i found this book to be an excellent resource even after my daughter left the nicu. that was a little over 2 years ago and i have a happy,healthy,beautiful, and very smart little girl! get this book!",1,118
"a debut novel showcasing an original literary talent.: a comic nightmare of black-magical realism, geoffrey cain's the wards of st. dymphna chronicles the exploits of brian mccorley through the dantean labyrinths of the unconscious as it spills out onto the streets and into the donut shops of small town california. seeing the world through a mad third eye, the reader sees brian's soul laid bare through his hilarious interactions with the inner, outer and underworld. a seemingly linear spiritual quest turns into a mobius strip mining of the soul, peeling the skin off a moment in time amidst a search for redemption into the comically unredeemable. the wards of st. dymphna is a debut novel showcasing an original talent that will leave its readers looking eagerly forward to geoffrey cain's next literary project.",1,133

"one of the best movies, i have seen in a long time: i would have given this movie five stars, but the ending made me change my mind. i am not going to say anything about the ending, because it will give the movie away for the people that haven't seen it. but this was one of the best movie's that i haven seen in a long time. it goes to show you that some people just don't care what others thing about you. that is what this movie told me. simon was a kid that was different from everybody else and he always thought that god made him the way he was for a certain reason and he was right. there was a lot of things that he didn't understand about some of the things that other people did and got into trouble sometimes. but it all worked out for the better at the end of the movie.",1,159

"gives a good light, easy to use: i bought this for our camping trip. it is very easy to use, i just clipped it onto the tent and we used it every night. the battery power seemed to be running out since it only uses 4 aa batteries, but apart from that it was good.",1,55
"funny, poignant, and all-too-true.: i first read this book twenty years ago, and i loved it. since then, my husband and i have built a house in the baja. god and mr. gomez has something of a cult following among those of us who have done so. incidentally, we all feel jack smith had it easy!",1,56

"fun reading: it took me a couple of tries to get into this book - maybe the historical period isn't of particular interest to me. i kept after it and i really did enjoy the stories.this isn't a novel - it's a collection of stories previously published in periodicals. don't expect a 'flow' - each story stands alone, as was the intent of the writer in writing for periodicals. the good thing about it is that you can read them story by story and put the book down not wondering what in the world happens next. the stories are entertaining and fun and short enough to read in one of those 'boredom windows' we all have - at the doctor's office, on the bus, or whenever we have to sit and wait for something.",1,134
"excellent!: with an odd-shaped console and dashboard in our vehicle, i really needed more versatility than a permanent or window 'suction' mount could offer. enter this product. the weight is enough to keep my unit where i choose to set it. the non skid rubber-like base is slightly moldable, to further enhance the ""stays put"" character of the product. the mounting stem locks into the base with a quick-release key. as an added safety feature, there is a locking lever which disables the quick release latch, avoiding unintentional releases from the base.",1,92
"very useful book: book was recommended for use by interpreter training program teacher as an additional tool. i have gotten considerable use out of it over the past year in my transliterating and asl classes. only one drawback just recently noted. the dvd is not supported by the newer mac os lion systems so i'm forced to use it on a windows based computer. other than that, very satisfied with this book.",1,72
"blade trinity: if you like vampires and sci fi action violence you would love blade trinitythe story is about a vampire named blade (wesley snipes) who is half vampire himself. in the movie blade has to fight the ultimate vampire evil . . . dracula. blade has some help from two younger vampire slayers but they are not much help when it comes to fighting dracula. will blade defeat dracula? find out in the action packed movie blade trinity.if you buy the dvd blade trinity there are some spectacular special features including deleted scenes, the unrated edition of blade trinity with ten extra minutes of vampires and action and much much more. i give this movie two thumbs up. there is great acting and wonderful use of emotion and violence. i recommend this movie to anyone older than 13 and not to children.",1,143
"630 reviews?????: you know, even the people who claim to hate this movie are writing about it. that alone says something about the movie. if they really hated it, why are they writing? i have seen better movies in my time, and i'm only 12 years old. and yes, in case you're wondering, i'm a girl. but i'm most certainly not one of those leo-infatuated blockheads.he's not as bad as some people say, though he could use a haircut, and a few more muscles. i admit that the reason that this movie is pg-13 rated seems a little inappropriate for a 1912 setting, but it's a love story, and how many people who are still alive were old enough in 1912 to remember what it was like then?please don't let the bad reviews phase you. it's good, not great, but it's still a movie everyone should see. i've seen star wars: episode i, and it's a lot better than titanic. but titanic is still good.",1,165
"an awesome read for any age: i have heard the book was out-of-this world. i didn't quiet believe it. i just finished the book in the wee hours of the morning. it is an amazing book! i can not wait to get to the store to buy #2. oh, by the way i am 32. if i had this book when i was younger i would have read a lot more than i did (and i read tons!!)",1,78
"this is a holiday keepsake.: anne margaret lewis' ""has anyone seen christmas?"" is sure to be holiday classic. vibrant color schemes and a clever refrain make this a joy to read, and reread. children will delight in trying to find christmas with emit, as well as enjoy seeing all the other holidays together. popko's illustrations are timeless and children will enjoy spending time just devouring her pictures, studying each holiday, and trying to find each holiday on the pages as the story progresses. what makes this book a true treasure is, not only is it highly entertaining it delivers a nice message with out being too noticeable in doing so. this is a holiday keepsake.",1,115
"simply the best: i bought the ""dymo discpainter"" that prints designs directly on printable cds but i got very different results depending on the exact blank cds i was using. i tried 5 or 6 different brands and styles. the last one was advertised as ""glossy"" so i had high hopes for a good result. well, the ink never dried on that cd and it ""stuck"" to the top lid of the cd jewel case! then i tried these cds. what a difference! the image was beautiful. it gives a smooth mirror like finish with all the colors brightly shown. it also dries quickly and the ink doesn't ""stick"" to anything. as far as i'm concerned these are the only printable cds worth using. they are simply the best made.",1,130
"freeway 2 is similar to freeway: on some of the reviews i have read on freeway 2, some of the people do not see the connection with the first movie freeway. i have seen both movies and like them both. freeway is a modern and twisted version of the little red riding hood story. freeway 2 is a very twisted version of the hansel and gretel story. that is the connection and why they both carry the same name even though the sequel doesn't have the same characters and a plot involving a freeway. i can't wait to see if there are more of the sequel upcoming.",1,107
"sound military brass!: this cd from the regimental band of the coldstream guards is good quality in terms of sound, in range of items, and in the quality of the playing. the band is well conducted, the items are played at proper tempo, and they cover key themes across the british isles in terms of national tunes.",1,57

"book good: everything was as said, condition great, i think i payed too much however, i may have tried to get a cheaper one, who knows it may have looked the same. there was no special edition seal or anything uniquely different from the regular copy my friend had.",1,49
"surprise: saw these guys live at baroeg, rotterdam. very enthusiastic i might add. so i decided to buy a cd from them. and i was amazed. great production, not to polished, not to raw. i wouldn't call this death metal though. it's more a blend of traditional metal and hardcore. a bit like pro pain, but more intense. check it out.",1,61

"another winner in this series: i am a big fan of shirley mcclintock and her family. i've read every one as soon as i could get my hands on them, and reread each so many times i'm afraid i will have to replace the books soon from sheer wear and tear. shirley is the non politically correct, common sense first opposite of every fluff headed ""heroine"" that clutter too many mysteries. the mysteries are clever and beguiling but it is the the people in the books i want to know more about. they are real, flawed, full flavored, and interesting. my only complaint is that ms oliphant cannot, under the present law, be forced to write more, more, more.",1,119
"also okay.: after getting ""thomas the tank engine & friends: sing-along and stories"", i needed to find more thomas songs and purchased this cassette too. don't know why, but it never caught on as much as the other cassette. it is still very well done, with the accompanying lyrics displayed on the screen and very colorful, but i still have to cast my vote and say that the ""tank engine and friends"" cassette is better.",1,75
"the best movie ever portrayed on any screen anywhere!!!!!: i first heard about ""gia"" on entertainment tonight right before it came out in january of 1998. i saw the movie on hbo about nine months later on the free preview and loved it. since i first saw it, angelina jolie has been my favorite actress. i recommend any angelina jolie movie, and i truly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys biographies and angelina jolie!",1,75

the fourth hand: very pleased. i couldn't put the book down. another irving book that makes you wonder where the hell he got some of these ideas. doesn't matter. go read it. i don't care what detailed reviews say (sure there are ways to disect the book). i don't care. it's just another very good book by irving. so go read it. worthy enough to splurge on the hardback to add to your library shelf. maybe even with some spot lighting on it.,1,83
"psychological scripture for freedom's soul: the book is a wonderful series of concise well-stated points to puncture the ""liberal clown ballons"" wherever i meet them in life. the world is becoming a dangerous place with socialism the great destroyer of nations.the only criticism i have is that the key points were repeated several times as if the master tutor does not want you to forget that liberalism is discredited and of no use --- period.p.s.liberals -- yo mama didn't raise you right and that is yo problem as they say it in new orleans",1,94
recipes really come out right: this is one of the few baking books i have used that i was able to count on the recipes coming out right every time. so far i have not made a flop from this book. i checked it out from the library intending to copy one or two recipes for my personal use but now intend to buy the book as i want all the recipes,1,72

"good and loud: so far i like this machine. it grinds well and fairly consistently. it is, however by far the noisiest contraption in the house. it sounds more like it's grinding rocks than coffee. maybe it has to do with the morning quiet, but it's loud. so i walk into the room, fire it up and leave while it does it's thing. not a problem with static like the krups grinder it replaced. all in all i'm happy with this grinder.",1,82

"verry stones sounding: i never thougt i hear another voice that souded like janis joplin but i was wrong.it is a cross between rod stewart and janis joplin. it works on the blues tunes like redunant but it a little to high for him on the rocking tunes like alice.if you can get by the singer voice which is better than pete ways voice ,i recomend you buy it ,great cd.",1,71

"sennheiser rs120 wireless headphones: these headphones are amazing! i had been looking for lightweight, wireless headphones for years - i even bought a couple that were either very heavy or just didn't work.as other reviewers have mentioned, these headphones work best when you turn off your tv's speakers and adjust the volume on the tv and headphones; i encounter major static when i don't do this (this is the only reason i didn't give them 5 stars). otherwise, they are perfect and, on my recommendation, my brother - who demands perfection - also bought them and also loves them.good job, sennheiser!update:i have been using these headphones for more than two years now and they still work as good as new (and i use them almost every day). love them!!!",1,129
"portrait of an artist: perhaps one of the best collections of poetry ever assembled, sylvia plath's poems are a must read for plath fans and poetry buffs alike. listed in chronological order (as much as possible), readers should pay particular attention to the poems from the summer of 1962 until the last poems in 1963 to fully appreciate the groundbreaking, enigmatic verse that defines sylvia plath. in addition to fifty poems written during her years as an undergrad at smith college, there is a very interesting selection of notes including the original order of poems in plath's ariel collection (the order of the posthumous collection was altered following her death). a wonderful gift for (literate) college students (and not just english majors).",1,122

"fascinating search for the fifth man, true life intelligence: story of british spies ~ mi5 in particular ~ from one who livedthrough it. wright was the first scientist to join mi5, the domesticspy-catchers, and led the way for others. the bulk of the book is taken up with the search for the fifth man ~ wright's candidate is roger hollis, who was head of mi5 during the early sixties ~ a well-hidden soviet mole like philby and his ilk. reading it, at times, it appears that wright considers himself responsible for every innovation in spy technology during the '50s and '60s, but if you can get over his view of himself, the book becomes a fascinating read, on a par with anything le carré wrote. as far as the fifth man goes, my mind is still open, but wright gives excellent cause to suspect that hollis probably was at least bent, if not broken.",1,154
"truly what i needed to know and more: i'm glad the negative reviews didn't scare me away from this book. it was a great read as well as an invaluable source of information. it directs you to the exact resources you need to buy or not buy, how much they are, where to get them, when to use them, what to pay attention to or skip, and it overall lets you know what to expect from the unexpected. in response to the negative points of contention i noticed... 1. it's over 800 pages: thank you! 2. the author is a hater: i would say a critic of legal education and his points make sense. whatever his beliefs, his advice is sound. 3. it really doesn't help: the book is supposed to be an informational tool to help structure a path toward educational success, not take your exams for you.law school is a huge investment for me, and thanks to this book i'm excited to take the next steps.",1,168

"best way to a sunless tan: i've seen tanning sheets on the shopping channels but didn't believe they worked as easily as they said - without streaking - until i tried the l'oreal towelettes. i've used the sublime bronze tinted self-tanning lotion for years, and these towellets are far superior since it's so much easier to smooth the tint all over, evenly and quickly, rather than tube-to-hand then hand-to-body. the color builds slowly over 2-3 applications but lasts about a week and fades fairly evenly, at least in my case. one towelette does indeed cover face, upper body and legs. just clean your hands after application as with any tanner and even if a little too much color gets on elbows, knees, or something, it's easy to even out the color by rubbing with a damp facecloth. the price isn't bad considering the convenience.",1,144
"this is the seminal cd for classics in the paradise garage!: the music on this cd is phenomenal... this 2 cd compilation is the best summarization of the beautiful music that was played on the garage's loud and crisp ""richard long"" system. all i can say to you is... get into it!",1,52

"a cracking movie, bold, impressive and unusual...: this wonderful movie, unlike any other (zulu was good but this is in a different class althogether). great visuals, stunning scenes, beautiful cinematography, a compelling script & story and the some of the very best actors (particularly connery & caine) at their best. this is not formula hollywood dross. nice finishing scene too. highly recommended.",1,62

"the dudarama of all movies: his dudeness no doubt had fun making this movie because i had so much fun watching it . . . after the first 2 times. before that, it seemed stupid and i would have probably given it only 2 or 3 stars. the more i watched, however, made me believe that this movie is the best work yet from the coen bros. definitely try it out- its a good movie to relate to. warning: have an open mind and a white russian in hand!",1,89
"i'll write a proper review later...: i haven't ""lived with"" this one long enough to give this an absolute star ranking but i found it to be ""edgier"" than simon's been in years musically and it was probably the most exciting thing from him sincethe rhythm of the saints. (i thought you're the one was kind of bland)as such, i'll give an unqualified recommendation that you borrow this one from a friend or your local library if you have any simon in your library outside of anthologies. it's certainly worth hearing and i'm likely to be adding it to my own collection.",1,102
"one of the best supplements: the problem with the atlantis supplement was that palladium didn't give us the level of description for the the cities of atlantis like they did for the vampire kingdoms. yes, there were more cities to keep track of, but the magic continent had much more promise.the ngr supplement redeems palladium. they don't give you layouts of cities like ciudad juarez, but you get a fat ol' book stuffed with information on the technologies, strategy, and culture of the ngr and gargoyle empire, with notes on the rest of the city.if you like big high-powered toys and high adventure, get this supplement and loose your pcs on some gargoyles and brodkil. if you are more subtle, there are a lot of cool espionage or political possibilities in this book. but whatever you are, if you are a big rifts fan, this is one of the best books you could get.",1,154
"didn't know what i was missing: i have to admit that i really didn't think much about johnny cash until i saw walk the line. i always thought he was cool, but didn't know much about his music. after watching the movie i decided to pick up a ""best of"" type album. i definitely feel like i picked the right one. man, he had a great voice and you get to hear him at the top of his game at different points in his career. if you like johnny cash, or are a little curious about his music, this is a great cd set. i defnitely recommend it.",1,108
"good deal for the price point: i bought these as a birthday gift for my daughter's 9th birthday. she requested binoculars so i wanted to give her something that was durable, water resistant and with decent optics, but not for $75-$100. these seem to meet all those criteria. i would be happy to use them for camping or at concerts. the only reason i am giving 4 stars and not 5 is because i just don't know how water resistant they are -- haven't been in the rain with them. i advised my daughter not to test them for water resistance!",1,101
"so far, so good...: i've used this machine several times and have not been disappointed. the instruction book is clear and concise (i love concise) and so far, the machine has performed exactly as promised. set-up time was minimal and the machine is easier to thread and much ""smoother"" and less noisy than those i have used in the past. additionally, the machine comes with an accessory kit that includes everything you need to get started and extra needles.very pleased with this purchase.",1,83

this book will inspire you not to settle: this was one of the best books on the topic i've ever read. it was a lot more than just an advice book on love--i was empowered that i can find the love of my life if i stopped settling and going out with men that i don't really care about.,1,59

"masterpiece: most books can be compared to other books; this one stands alone. i have never read anything like it. the author has a clear,lyric but unobtrusive prose style and the ability to cast himself back in time to capture the flavor of american life decade by decade since 1900. it's like looking at a collection of old life magazines in the attic, only better. really makes you feel you were there. buy it and you will not regret it.",1,80

"like finding an old friend: i read this book as a kid but that was long enough ago that reading it again was like discovering it for the first time. this is probably the best known of all of the sherlock holmes stories and it it really deserves it's classic status. it is a gripping tale mixing crime investigation with a touch of the supernatural and is after 100 years still a page-turner. arthur conan doyle helped start a genre that continues to entertain as evidenced by the countless crime novels and detective shows on tv. despite the potential overexposure sherlock holmes and dr watson still seem relevant and the deductive reasoning holmes employs to solve the mystery of the hound of the baskervilles is so entertaining that i read this in one day, unable to put it aside. crime solving raised to a high art form never gets old.",1,150
"a predictable yet engrossing read: anne rice fans will find much that is familiar in ""cry to heaven"", although unlike her other popular novels, there is no element of the supernatural present here. this is a book that will transport the reader back to 18th century italy, into a world of politics, intrigue, corruption, and most of all, music. rice's writing is as full and rich as always, with detailed settings and fully realized characters. the novel is well-researched, i learned much about the time period that i didn't know before.the flaw? i found most of the major plot twists to be extremely predictable. i won't give anything away, but every time something shocking happened, i had already guessed what was to come at least a chapter before. maybe i've just read too many books. regardless, i would still recommend this book to any anne rice fan.",1,147

"it's not really fair to compare the kinks to the beatles: because i mean after all, the kinks have talent! ya, i liked the beatles---with all their pretension---and all that, until i heard the brothers d and then i realized that there is one man who figured it all out 30 years ago. i mean the reason rock intellectuals describe ray davies as a genius is beacuse he is!... the back to basics production and beautiful melodies make the village green essential listening! i just wish they'd make this album in closed caption, because then we'd all have world peace!",1,100
"great item: got this item in the mail last week and i'm very happy with it. i'm a slim guy but the armband fits nice and tight, but not uncomfortable. can't beat it for the price!",1,36

"a very raw independent film: quite enjoyable, with lovely cinematography and a plot that moved along well. the characters all have their secrets, and half the fun is trying to decide who has the biggest secret. the performances were all enjoyable- i especially liked the teenager seamus. the end? surprising, yes, but nothing earth-shattering.",1,54
the best ever: jericho is the best show i have ever watched and it gives us a glimpse of what could come...i rate this series a ten. my husband and i are so disappointed that the show was canceled after the second series.jake is my hero....,1,46
"kill the aliens!: so, this was the title release when the ps3 hit the market. looks great. gave a new perspective to military shooters...you're fighting aliens. i'm not much for multi-player, so i can't comment on that.i do have a beef about no trophies. what was sony thinking? i feel trophies give another level of challenge to games...plus some bragging rights. :-) good thing they added them to resistance 2. if you care about the trophies, skip this one and get resistance 2. i'd expect resistance 3 to step it up even more.",1,93
review on speedstacks: this toy is very fun and it also helps you train your hands. it is glow in the darkso you can have fun with it at night. you can also bring it to school and show your friends how good you are.,1,45
"a very strong record: i really can't help but dismiss the coldness spread out by some critics when this album came out. while this isn't her best-of-all album, it's still at least a four-outta-five stars one. i really love her version of springsteen's tougher than the rest and if it wasn't for any other song, this would still earn a four. who cares if it's a bit soundlarge every now and then! who cares about the ""formula"". it's a hell of an album. one simpl<y can't judge emmylou's albums by any formula or anything but her singing. just listen to it!!!",1,101
"a great mix of ki ho'alu: a good mixture of different styles of slack key. my favorite is the first number, ""steal away"", that has a great classicak uke solo by dennis kamakahi. panini pua kea is also great, recalling the sons of hawaii. their version of palolo, though, pales in comparison to the one by the ka'au crater boys.",1,60
"jeremiah: i was hooked from the first episode. this isn't just another show, that entertains from episode to episode. this grips you and leaves you wanting more.the best part about the dvd's is that the next episode is just minutes away, instead of a week away.i'm glad to have this as part of my collection, and can't wait to have season two, sitting right beside it.",1,66
"asi is wonderful: this book is a must without it i would never have passed the test i learned more with it than taking the class at trees, the cd lets you practise taking the test over an over, this was the best investment i could have made, i had to take the test over after ordering this asi i passed the test no problem . thanks thanks thanks if you are going to take the test get this book",1,80
"you'll need more than one gin sling to get through this!: this has to be, without a doubt, the most bizarre film i have seen in years. how it ever made it past the hays office beggars the mind. it makes caligula look normal. it is easily the sleaziest film in ages. now having said that, it has a wonderful cast, great direction and excellent photography. but the atmosphere; it's sort of like casablanca on drugs! and ona munson is the icing on the cake - if she was beautiful, sensuous and kind as belle wattling in gone with the wind, she is the ultimate dragon lady here. don't miss this one if you want to see hollywood in extremis!",1,120
big size cookie big size taste: erin baker's breakfast cookies are not just for breakfast. you can have one anytime and they are so big you will enjoy eating them for a long time. we ordered the oatmeal raisin cookies and they were so moist and delicious. i wondered where they were going to so fast and discovered that my husband was taking them to work with him. so they must be very good because he is not a dessert person at all!,1,83

"as creative and colorful as the subtitle says!: if you like felt crafts, you're sure to love this book. from practical to whimsical, from cute to wild, these crafts offer something for everyone. there are frames, banners, pillows, accessories, toys, and more. one project offers an amazing new take on felt: using a woodburning tool to create a celtic banner. you might not need to make these projects - the book is presented so well, you can browse it like an art book! you're sure to come away smiling.",1,89
"house oversight: this binder is exactly what i needed to keep my pages organized. as an important congressional leader, i have many pages in my office, and hope to have a steady supply of new ones coming in the future. as soon as i saw that one of the features of this binder is back-mounted rings that allow pages to lie flat, i knew i had found the perfect tool for organizing pages. i had never really even thought of using binders to organize them, but this really keeps them under control. thanks for the great idea, mitt!",1,98
"learn the finer art of driving safely: if we rely on our eyes for 90% of the information we need to operate a car, why has no one ever thought of vision as the basis of a driver education program before? this excellent book tells us that the reality is that our eyes and our visual attention are our most important crash-guards. the writer, dr. kenneth c. mills, makes his point on why good vision is so important and then tells us how to develop our attention to make us safer drivers. you can read this book in one sitting and learn ways to become a safer driver -- it could save your life. it contains many of the things you always wanted to tell your new teen-aged driver, but didn't really know how to explain. the book even provides some exercises you or your new driver should do -- before you turn over the keys to the car.",1,159

"can't argue with success!: it's really difficult to argue with success! today is october 3. i've been on this diet since july 13, and i'm down 44 lbs -- from 241 to 197. my total cholesterol has dropped significantly as well. my wife has lost 24 lbs in the same time span. i'm never truly hungry, and i don't think about snacking anymore. i really can't believe how well it's gone for me. i've recommended this diet to several friends, too, and now i'm watching them lose weight. the real key is to get thru the 1st week -- when you're getting off caffeine, sugar, and carbs all at once, it feels like detox! i was lethargic and frankly, a little stupid! but at the end of two weeks i felt great, and it's been great ever since. get the book, give it a month, and you're likely to stick with it and lose a ton of weight.",1,158
"perfect table saw, perfect grav-rise stand, for my portable needs, since i don't have a dedicated shop!!: i gave it 5 stars because, although no saw in the ""portable range"" imho is perfect....this one is perfect for me. comments about no blade lock, ambiguous blade angle determination, and a few others, are all justified, but those are generally only found on shop saws which have bigger tables, twice the cost [approx], and are considerably heavier. again, it's all about what works for you. this puppy is a dream to slide on to the bed of a pickup [check out youtube for the skinny on how it's done]. as for complaints about the quality [or lack of] of the saw blades, consider this! absolutely no manufacturer supplies their saws with high quality blades. period!!",1,133
"robbie shaw's boeing 747: great book for 747 fans!: this book is the greatest boeing 747 book i have read so far; i have my own copy and i never tire of looking through it and admiring the great photos and detailed captions telling the whole story of the particular aircraft pictured, including its name, tail number, previous owners, etc. i also love the text; it is a great history of all the series of 747s: -100, -200, cargo, sp, -300, and -400. some of my favorite photos are of a twa 747-100, the pan am 747s, the sps, and the aer lingus 747-100. the only things that are missing that i'd like to see are ""classic"" 747s (delta, american, braniff, national, etc) and interior shots. otherwise, an a-1 747 book for jumbo fans like me!francis smith (smitfj01@holmes.ipfw.edu) garrett, indiana usa",1,141

"the best wine glasses for the money!: these are the best! they are incredibly well priced considering they have such thin, cut rims. they are a pleasure to drink out of. they are not ostentatiously tall or large like many other glasses on the market, so they are very easy to handle at the table, even after you've had a few glasses of wine. they have a nice, general shape which works well with a lot of different types of wine. i have both the white wine and red wine glasses and love them both. if you are not a wine snob but want well made glassware, these are for you.",1,111
"magnificient: both poetry and scholarship at its finest: this book is without doubt the greatest ever written. if one were to die tomorrow without having read the book, one would not have lived. the english language contains too few superlatives to describe every nuance. what a book!!!",1,47
"good album: first song i heard was ""yellow"" and always cheered me up on the radio. i bought parachuetes and really really dug them. about as much as radiohead. spies is a fav of mine. everythings not lost was my least fav.the second album i didnt like too much. ive only listened to the whole thing twice but some songs are good, like clocks,politik and a few more.this album is good. about the same as parachuetes. yes, its more pop but id rather get good pop from coldplay than bad pop from jennifer lopes. i can listen to the whole album without turning it off.id give it 4n a half starz but i cant so 5 will do.",1,118
best cleaning wipes i have used.: we use a lot of simple green product at work and bought some of these to try out. abrasive on one side and soft on the other they are great for cleaning about anything. in the last year these have become my go-to product for wiping down about anything. i am here on amazon.com today to buy some for home.,1,66
"**i liked it**: i read the negative reviews but because i tested the toy in toys r us i knew what to expect. the volume of the station is not too great and you can't see yourself too well on the tv but what do you expect for a $50 kids ""toy"". it is nice because you can plug it into your tv and sing along with the songs and hear your voice coming out of the tv. not exactly educational but i think it is good for my toddler because it will encourage her to sing and dance. i only wish they had cartridges with elmo, wiggles or other favorite chidren entertainers.",1,113
"works fine on the wide seat of my exercise bike: i bought this seat cover to replace the one i had on my exercise bike, which has a wide seat, and it works great. it's a little longer than the seat is, but that really posed no problem. like all gel seat covers the gel moves around to conform to the shape of your butt and your movement. i replaced the old one, a different brand, because it had became lumpy and misshapen after a long period of time. so to prevent that with this new one i remove the cover about once a month or so, depending on use, then realign it back on the seat, to prevent the lumping. so far so good.",1,125
"the best way to hear genesis: altough maybe you already have the cd's in this collection, if you really like them won't let pass this box. the 5.1 mix of the disks are really really awesome. the bonus videos also fulfills the expectations. why 4 stars? the dts mix sound a lot lot lot much better than the dolby one. why is this? i don't know, but i think is something you should be aware of.",1,76

"ahab's bride: ahab's bride is captivating. although i am not easily hooked into a novel, i was hooked almost before i could take a breath. i could hardly put the book down until i was finished.from the first paragraph the reader is transported back in time to 19th century nantucket into the world of moby dick's captain ahab and the woman who falls love with him. with an impeccable depiction of the period, louise m. gouge walks us through the dusty streets of two whaling communities and into the lives of these fictional, but realistic characters.hannah rose, the viewpoint characer, is a woman who transcends time, a woman we easily identify with, a strong woman who goes after her dreams and faces life with honesty and courage, somewhat reminiscent of ida in cold mountain.meanwhile, the person of captain ahab, as seen through the eyes of love, takes on new and intriguing dimensions which make you want to brush off your copy of moby dick and read it all over again.",1,170

"tess monaghan book two: tess monaghan, newspaper writer turned p.i. is a good read. i think i like it because tess is real. the reader must make it through her life with her and that is refreshing. balitmore mresidence should love the book and lippman obviously does. i didn't enjoy this second book as much as the first one but this series is solid and worth the read. recommended",1,69
"amazing: i love this game! it is very good becuase of the great gameplay and graphics. i think this is going to be ten times better than blitz. it will have more players, plays, and tricks along with the same great gameplay. i can't wait till this game comes out and your crazy if don't think this is going to be a good game. i have always been a madden fan but nfl street will blow it away. i also heard that a secret players like lt and barry sanders. go out and get this game now!",1,97

"she sucks! she's great!!: lol. i am a die-hard fun of geri, until this most recent cd she released entitled 'passion.' yuck!! it kills me to type bad things about her, i even had a geri fansite! i hate her most recent album, but to my surprise, i like this single! it's not one of the only 3 decent tracks (superstar, ride it, don't get any better) on her new album, but the remixes make it seem better! track 1 is 3:21, track 2 is 6:30, and track 3 is 7:10.",1,91
"wave rocking music: with the perfect storm composer james horner has written music that perfectly explores the mighty sea. the music is at times soft and gentle, like the calm sea. then he allows his music to swell as a rising sea would. this is action music. the addition of an acoustic guitar in some cues adds a mystical element to his score. although it does get repetitous at times, this is still solid and imaginative work.",1,77

"best of the prey series: lucas davenport ain't never going to be harry bosch, but he's a good enough morally ambivalent character that you care about what he does and why he does it. of the prey series, this is a standout for its plot about ugly sexual behavior in the sticks and for its detailed evocation of minnesota in the dead (no pun intended) of winter. mystery aficionados already know this book, and they'll tell you that another great thing about it is that sandford plays fair with the plot. things get strange, but there's a logical thread throughout. superior reading for long-distance air travel.",1,106

"excellent shakespeare compilation: this cd has it all: shakespeare period music for mood and background music, songs actually written into shakespeare's plays and talent infused into every track. every song is done well by talented musicians and vocalists and the selection is great. if you are looking for the songs you see featured in your favorite shakespeare play and would like to hear them, or would like background music to play while you peruse ""the merry wives of windsor"" or any other plays from that time period, i recommend this cd.",1,91
"good book: i got this book as a gift and it has become one my favourite cook books. puris, dosas, aloo bondas...all things that never turned out right for me. but ever since i started using this book, everything turns out perfect in one try! the measurements are so accurate and that's rare in an indian cook book. there's also a very good mix of south and north indian foods and all recipes come with calorie counters and a breakdown (protein/carb/fat per serving). the best part is that the author has american substitues for all the hard-to-find/hard-to-make indian ingredients (like homemade yoghurt and paneer). i would recommend this book to any beginners trying to learn indian cooking in an american kitchen!",1,121
"great spoof movie: i am on older gentleman and have either read or saw movies from all of these characters that this movie is spoofing. i find it highly entertaining and funny. some younger folks might not know who charlie chan,the thin man or poirot is but still think the movie is entertaining. if you do know who people like miss marple or sam spade is you will really get a kick out of this movie.",1,76
"amazingly brutal: extreme conditions demand extreme responses was a little too simple but a good debut. brutal truth go experimenting here with hardcore punk and industrial but still manage to keep straight up grind in their music. my favorite on the album is godplayer, it starts out slow and industrialish, then gets insanely fast with kevin sharps screaming vocals. his lyrics are almost indecipherable which is a good thing, it makes the music more brutal. another thing i like about brutal truth is that they don't sing about satan or death like a lot of metal bands. they go against trends and sing political songs and songs about social issues. if you're just an average heavy metal fan this may be to brutal for you but if you like extreme stuff, buy this!",1,133
"a good movie: i think this is a good movie. you might have to watch it twice before you understand it. the story has been compressed very tightly, transitions are short, characters develop suddenly, and nearly every line of dialogue is essential. this doesn't prevent it from being an enjoyable movie; it just requires the viewer to pay close attention.",1,60
"good, but fragmented.: i don't find any infos about this budget 4cd box.if you want buy some from legendary tango (jazz) man piazzolla, this is small info: only 2nd disc is taken form studio recordings.it is from late 60's.first disc includes concert in roma 1972 (piazzolla's nonet)third disc includes concert in milano 1984(quintet)fourth disc is from 1976 - it is electric piazzolla.but sound is good. and music too.",1,68

"a fascinating perspective of history !!: quigley has done an immense job writing the history of the world from the elitist point of view. the winner, the powerful, and the wealthy usually write the history. biased or not, based on evidence or not, they write the history or pay someone to do it for them, either way, they make it reality and a basis for the future of the world. as a reader, you must understand the history and the context in which it was written, in order for you to comprehend the dangers of the present and to predict the urgency of the future.the tragedy in this book is in the narcissism of quigley and his oligarchy, and the vanishing hope is in the faith and the hands of the determined and decent people............",1,135
sweet service: it was fast and quick. the item works great and it was in perfect and genuine condition!!! definitely going to buy more in the future..,1,27
better than anticipated.: this film was one that i at first hesitated to see but was quite impressed when i did. i think miguel nunez jr.(not orlando jones) was very funny in this comedy film. vivica fox was as lovely as always. in order to see this kind of movie one must come with an open mind and understand it's something not to be taken too seriously. i have to say i'm happy to see miguel nunez getting more work and recognition than usual. he's truly a very talented actor and hopefully we'll see more of him. i have to say that i'm a little disappointed that so far there's no soundtrack for the film. it has great music in it.,1,121

"multiple uses at a brilliant price: first of all, i didn't buy these for a child, but for an adult friend of mine who makes jamaican-style music (reggae and dub). while these are labeled as a ""toy"" or for children, they can also be utilized for just about anything music related.the paint is durable, and the diameter is thin enough to accommodate a myriad of hand sizes. the sound is what you would expect from a rhythm stick, and to be honest, why would you pay the up-mark for music-specific branded ones?overall, a solid buy for all ages.",1,98
"absolutley great!: the mother hips are just about the greatest band in the world. if you've got a country heart and a surfer soul then nothing beats this album...except their previous album ""shootout"" which is probably the greatest album ever made.",1,41

"concise and adequate: i generally do not like reading thick books. this book is not only ideal for the busy executive, but also for that ""lazy student"" who has much beter things to do in life. at the end of each chapter, the key take-aways are summarized. it is interesting to note that murdoch can compromise ethics and journalistic integrity to further his business. he also has a nack of thinking and planning lightyears ahead of his rivals, and can stoop at any level to keep the chinese happy (bbc, critical reporting, scrapping chris patten's autobiography et all).",1,98

"love it: i am really glad i bought this. it is so handy and works great. i don't have a dishwasher, so it has never been in one, but it has been in a sink full of water for extended periods of time. i haven't had a problem with water in the handle or rusting. it's just a great stainless steel flat whisk that works great for scrambled eggs and sauces/gravies in a large skillet.",1,75
"professional help from italian-speaking writers: if you are a coach, this book is for you. its concepts are complex and the book assumes an already detailed knowledge of the game. there are several attacking patterns that i guarantee will help your team, as well as concepts and drills to improve individual and group attacking play. for someone who played defense in college and specializes in defense at the collegiate coaching level, the book is helpful if one-sided. the italians focus on a zonal defense, and in general flat-back defense is detailed. there is some very good stuff in here to help build a defense. additionally, almost any formation you can imagine is given a quick glance by a professional coach who uses it and notes its advantages and disadvantages. the one criticism i have is the clumsy writing--these guys are definitely not american.",1,143

"a worthy sequel!: i debated for a month or so after readingoutlander (20th anniversary edition): a novelabout continuing with the series. the first book was truly outstanding and i didn't want to ruin it with a series that went downhill or was drug out for thousands of pages. i was so wrong! i loved ""dragonfly in amber"" almost as much as its predecessor. it was not as action packed, but i liked the pace of the plot. i loved reading about jamie and claire's time in paris. the infamous black jack randall (best villain ever. love to hate him!) returns with a surprise! just a great story all around. beware though, after the heartwrenching ending, you will be on tovoyager (outlander)straight away!",1,122
"an excellent book and analysis: this book is a very impressive piece of work. shattan is very fair when he writes about each and every person, no matter what their political stripe. from churchill's prescient knowledge of what must be done to truman's acknowledgement of the danger that communism posed to adenauer's firm and unwavering alignment with the west to solzihentisyn(sp?) showing how the cold war was really a moral struggle to pope john paul ii's unwavering determination to free poland to ronald reagan who ultimately caused the end of the cold war; even though it came under bush's administration; shattan demonstrates a keen eye for details and an excellent sense of analysis. this is well worth reading for anyone interested in the cold war.",1,125
"by the fans, for the fans.: this is an excellent well-made documentary. i was not expecting that at all. it left me with an empty shallow feeling, but sometimes that's just how life is. if you consider yourself a kiss fan, you need to watch this documentary. it will make you see kiss from the perspective of true kiss fans. there is no happy ""hollywood"" ending here, you might even start to dislike kiss after watching this, but you'll definitely feel something for the fans.",1,85

"a thorough overview, but not for beginners: after working with unix of various flavours for over ten years, i needed to learn aix in a hurry. this is a thorough book, with plenty of examples and careful, detailed explanations. there is a good introduction to rs/6000 and pseries hardware, and then the reader is pushed into the operating system at the deep end. you will need a good grounding in unix to get through this book -- it's not a beginner's introduction. my only gripe is that the index is rather sparse -- you need to be very patient if you don't know exactly what you're looking for. but for the right audience, this book is a real treasure.",1,119

wheel of time: artwork has nothing to do with the book. i create all the picturs in my mind anyway. if i want to buy a book for pictures i'll buy a comic book. this book however was great. in the large elaborate world of this series a guide is almost a necessity. i know it takes from some of the intrigue of the book. but there are so many characters that directly relate to the plot that i think some of the facts covered in this book will never see print in the series. i highly recommend this to all true fans. i have read the series almost as many times as there are book in the series. maybe even more. i am unsure. but i still like the information presented here. artwork is never as good as the pictures in my head anyway.,1,145
heartwarming: the book is very heartwarming. its about a sister that is called home to help take care of her sick brother. i would recommend it to everyone. it is very well written.,1,33

"deserves to be better-known: this, the second in bergman's ""faith"" trilogy, is a dark, brooding tale of a clergyman who has lost his faith in god. indeed, it is doubtful at all if he ever had it, for his vision of god is quite selfish. the action takes place on a single sunday in november, where the town pastor (gunnar bjornstrand in an excellent performance) is finishing a service in front of a tiny congregation. during this day, the pastor will be forced to examine himself and to try to reach out for some human contact to replace the spiritual depletion within him. also starring max von sydow, gunnel lindblom, and ingrid thulin as the schoolteacher who unselfishly offers herself to the pastor but is rejected in favor of the memory of his dead wife. this film has a subtle, deeply wrought poetry to it and should be seen by all lovers of intelligent cinema.",1,155
"a big leap forward!: before i got this book, i was already playing for many years. when it would come around for me to write my songs down for others to play, it was more of a sloppy mess of chords, and drawn arrows pointing ""go back here""...stuff like that. that all changed when i got ""the guitarist to sight reading"" not only my charts are much more professional looking, but i'm also much sharper at my note reading. i am now able to write out certain rhythmic patterns at any part of the song if i want it there.this book is not only fun, because it has a cd that can play along with, but you can also see your progress grow in such a short time. a must for any serious musician who wants to get thing done neatly and quickly!",1,143

"a brilliant resource: i aquired this book when a friend whom i had helped several times professionally as a hypnotherapist asked me to help her prepare for natural child birth.the book proved invaluable not only in the way it assisted in the deprogramming of the negative expectations and fear of chilbirth pervading our culture, but also as a basis of ideas from which to negotiate and plan a bespoke approach to preparing her and her birth team for the big event.it's not complete in itself and really does need to be used by someone competent in hypnosis, (we used other techniques form other disciplines as well) but it's a superb resource and i envision recommending it to many more people.and by the way, my friend felt no need to use pain relief, reported no pain, only ""sensations"", and she wasn't in any way attempting to mask the pain and the midwfe recorded second stage as lasting approximately 2 minutes!",1,159

"the girl w/ the dragon tattoo: the first bit of the movie, i guess i wasn't paying attention to or not reading the subtitles fast enough, because i had no idea what was going on. a third of the way through everything started clicking for me and from about that moment on i was completely enthralled. the suspense built up at a steady pace and i was gripping my chair waiting to see what would happen next. i thought it was shot well, the actors acted well, and the whole thing was a great film.",1,95
"impressed for the price: we bought these from a friday sale and have been really happy. they are warm and don't ball up even after a few washes. the flannel is really soft as well. we've purchased other discounted sheets and haven't been happy so i was taking a gamble on these, but we really enjoy them and you can't beat the price!",1,63

"sublime soul...: the back of this cd states that this is simply the best philly soul album you can buy, and i can't disagree. the spinners put it all together on this one: soulful vocals, top notch songs, and great arrangements. the best word i can use to describe this music is smooth. every time i hear the opening strains of ""just can't get you out of my mind"" or ""i'll be around"" i know it's time to chill. also, the seven minute ""i could never (repay your love)"" contains one of the best vocal performances by the late great lead vocalist phillipe wynne. if you are a fan of soul music or r&b of any kind this disc should be in your collection.",1,124

"one of the few folic acid + vitamin b complex in one pill: i've been taking sundown xtra for several years and have found it to be an excellent product. in order for folic acid to be effective in lowering homocysteine levels, it needs to be taken in conjunction with vitamin 6 & 12, this product allows you to get the benefit of a maximum dose of folic acid (800mcg) and the necessary vitamin b's all in one caplet. much easier than having to buy folic acid and vitamin b complex *separately* in order to properly augment. although recent studies have questioned the relevance of homocysteine levels regarding cardiac health, i believe there's a great deal of merit in continuing to take folic acid. my homocysteine levels decreased substantially (from a 14 to an 8) after taking this folic acid/vitamin b complex combination for six months. i would strongly recommend it. wishing you all the best of health.",1,158

"proud to show nails: i started using nailtiques formula 2 about a year ago. my nails were so thin and if i were lucky enough for them to grow at all, the tips would peel off. i tried many ""nail hardener"" products with no success. nailtiques is the most amazing product and so easy to use. i don't use any remover - after a few coats are applied, it is so easy just to lift the whole coat off, and start over. i don't try to remove it off all my nails at once - just the ones that appear to need lifting off at the moment. agreed you must be consistent with the application instructions but it only takes about 3 minutes to apply and dries pretty fast, like 10 minutes or so. this product is much cheaper ordering from amazon.com than buying locally even with shipping and handling. one review writer mentioned the bottle brush separating from the top - just reclose bottle until it catches on and start over.it finally stops this nuisance.",1,176

"excellent value: i received the shade sooner than i thought. the stainless steel hardware that came with it was of very good quality and really helped in the installation. i attached this shade to the side of my aluminum awning that was on the back of my house, because the sun was shinning under the awning during the afternoon and evening hours. this shade looks very nice, and worked exactly like i wanted it to. i can also unhook it from the poles i put up, and let it hang down the side of the awning to block all the sun and keep the rain from getting under the awning when it's raining. i can tell by the way it's made, that it should last a long time. i paid more for this shade than some of the other's on the market, but i'm glad i did. it's top notch.",1,150

"lightweight cord reel: this is a lightweight, inexpensive cord reel that actually holds 150 feet of 14-gauge extension cord. the only thing i would have liked would be if there was a way to have the plug extend from the reel so that you could plug it in without having to completely unwind it from the reel. otherwise, it works as advertised.",1,62

seven from thebes: 01/07/12i received the movie in a timely fashion and in good condition. the movie was just fine. it is now part of my permanent collection.,1,28
please stop comparing this show to the original!!!!: first off this is a seperate movie from the original. also as much as i love gena rowlands i did not like the original gloria so i dont see everyones fascination with it. on its own i thought this show was great. i saw it on tv very early in the morning so my expectations were low. and i am not a very big fan of sharon stone at all but i was very presently surprised by this show. personally i think this is one of her best roles and i thought she did it wonderfully. i think you should give this show a shot based on its own merits alone. its not the best movie ever but its definitely not the worst either. so basically its touching/heart-warming and has some good action and definitely worth at least a once over so take a chance and may you also be pleasently surprised.,1,160
"good coverage of material.: because the topic is changing so quickly, it is difficult to publish a current book on xml. even with this disadvantage, the book gives the reader the information needed to understand how xml works, what its potential is, and generally how to implement it. i have two negative comments:1. the book is a too cursory with emerging technologies which will be the mainstay of the technology: dom, xsl, xslt, sax. these parts are critical for implementors and should have been discussed more thoroughly.2. for a book on markup, they should have gotten the table of contents marked up correctly.on the whole, an excellent book. very readable.",1,110
"sensationally wicked masterpiece!: a best-seller in its day, quaker city is a violent and surreal look at the life of the citizens of philadelphia in the 1840s. anyone who likes edgar allen poe or the marquis de sade will find this an interesting read; written off by critics as blatantly pulp, before such a term existed, they considered its mass appeal a sign of weakness, and by 1900, it had vanished from most lists of important american novels. i'm glad that critics are reconsidering its position, and i look forward to more of lippard's novels coming back to print. devil-bug, the mastermind of evil, is a great villain, and he looks ahead to jarry's pere ubu, faulkner's popeye and many of the great surreal or superreal villains of the twentieth century.",1,131
"a must-have to any comic and batman fan!: first of all i wouldn't call this product a 'toy' per se but a true collectible. this tiny action figure is batman at his simplest and yet it is the most complex representation in plastic of the dark knight.there is not a single classic pose you could not re-create with this figure and more than five extra pair of interchangeable hands can attest to that fact.a decent amount of accesories make this figure a true collector's kit and even this is not meant for little kids (they tend to be fragile)you can not help but to feel like one when you see batman on display over his pegged, transparent stand -also included- in that pose you could never achieve with that old batman you had when you were a kid.it is a great investment for you, the collector. not so for the kids.",1,151
"easy to install: this filter was a breeze to install; granted, the old kenmore brand filter that this new one replaced was installed with quick-release fittings. while the new filter came with nice brass fittings (with the tread already wrapped in teflon tape!), i decided to use my existing quick-release fittings, which allowed me to swap out the filter in less than a minute. so far, it has been a month, and the water tastes great. the 20,000-gallon life span of this filter was a major factor in my decision. i have well water, and this gives me peace of mind, knowing that my water is getting properly filtered. one thing you may want to do: read the instructions. the manufacturer recommends flushing the filter for a few minutes when you first connect it to the supply line to make sure there is no residual charcoal dust coming out of it. this is normal with most water filters and in spite of having forgotten to do that, i did not experience any problems.",1,173
"solid product: a solid product that works just as advertised. what goes in is what comes out -- that is, no signal deterioration or no interference between the channels. i am a very satisfied customer.",1,35
"wow: i expected a little more of carrie, but this album is still amazing.my favorite songs are ""some hearts"", ""jesus,take the wheel"", and ""i ain't in checotah anymore"". five of my friends {two boys three girls,} all liked this album. three words, buy this album. and i'm also looking forward to bo bice's album which comes out december 13.",1,59
"enjoyable contemporary prose.: matt arnold has created a relatable tale, spun in the aftermath of friendships scattered to the winds, through the personal experiences of one of those friends.an exploration of everyday america and human perceptions and emotions: ""he still reeked of alcohol. it seeped from his pores like a bastard son of old spice or hai karate.""validation of the connectedness of friends and their impact on our lives. one that not even death can sever.",1,76
"a positive review from a republican!: let's get one thing straight, i am a hardcore conservative and will most definitely be voting for bush in november. while i in no way, shape or form agree with propagandhi's politics, i still think their music is great, which is kind of weird because they're so closely tied together. for me, their views don't diminish the listenability of this album, because it appeals to me as a rock record. tracks like ""purina hall of fame"" and ""march of the crabs"" are great pieces of music, no matter what side of the political spectrum you're on. so if you by chance are a right-winger and like kickass hardcore with a little melody, download a few of these songs, you might be surprised.",1,128
"packs a punch: just finished installing this at my daughter's house. she has a fenced back yard, but the dog kept digging under it and she was afraid she would have to get rid of her. since the dog is otherwise very sweet and a wonderful playmate for my 6-year-old granddaughter, i knew we had to do something to keep her. we installed the fence, not in the ground, but on the existing fence a few inches off the ground and looped back some 3 feet above that wire. to begin, i should have set the collar at level 3. instead, i set it at 5 and gave the poor dog a really rough shock. i set it to 3 and she feels it but doesn't yelp like she's being tortured. at the moment, she is leery of going back outside, but i think she'll be ok as soon as she realizes she still has the rest of the yard to play in.",1,163
"a summer treat fat free, guilt free: this mix is probably not something you would want to use everyday. its just new enough and different enough to be something special to add to your summertime recipe's. when you want to reward yourself with something fun and fruity, this can fill the bill quickly and easily. it has no aftertaste so often associated with diet drinks. i highly recommend it.",1,69
"the man is truly human...: i think we all grow up hearing, reading and being told about the founding fathers but rarely do any of us really read about them as individuals. every time i do i'm amazed at what i read and how far ahead of their time they really were. benjamin franklin epitomizes this; printer, scientist, inventor, diplomat, politician and above it all human. this book gets into some of that nitty-gritty; the women, the ruthless businessman, more women, questionable husband and father.the author does an amazing job walking us through franklin's life and showing us the brilliance of the man and the fallibility at the same time.wonderful read and would recommend it to everyone - just be prepared to devote some time to it.",1,127
"great book!: i have personally read this book from cover to cover serveral times and i think it is the of most imformative books you can find. wheither your in the early stages of starting a micor-isv company or well into one, you will be refering to this book again and again. the chapters are well laid out, with each one addressing the steps a person/company needs to consider as they develop their micro-isv. bob writes in an engaging style and provides the reader with great examples to get his point across.",1,92
"finally a memoir that i actually want to read!: i fell in love with chelsea when i first saw her show. she has this type of dry, sarcastic humor that i find completely hilarious. this is the first of the books that she wrote even though it's not my favorite.each chapter is about a new man that entered chelsea's like (and more often than not, exited just as quickly). with wit and humor chelsea revisits several one night stands that stood out in her life. accompanied by her saucy group of gal pals, handler takes on every city with the same attitude: find a glass of vodka and a hot man, stat!it's completely irreverent and full of language that will disgust the average prude, this is a memoir for anyone who enjoys chelsea's naughty sense of humor.",1,137
"breathtaking novel: don't believe that guy - he obviously has no taste in literature. (as fontane would say, he has no eye for it because he has no love for it.) this is one of my favorite books ever. fontane's insights into people and society are accurate to this day, and his classic love story is unforgettable.",1,57
"terrific case for running with nike+: i would highly recommend this case if you are a runner and are using the nike+ ipod system. i have had this case for almost a year and i still love it. i use it several times a week for running, as well as, during my training for a half marathon. i live in very hot climate and i don't even notice that i have it on my arm. the dual straps for wrist or upper arm placement make it even better. in the winter months, the wrist position works well wtih a long sleeve top. this case provides a tight fit for the ipod and the nike+ receiver, while the clear window provides easy access for selections on the ipod. i will buy another as the neoprene is beginning to split where it has to fit over the receiver but it definitely was worth the price, considering how much i have used it.",1,160

"nice but a few issues: i have been using the sport kit for a few months and i really like it. it is easy to use, uploading to the site is a breeze and it is making a difference in my workouts. i did have difficulty with callibration and i still think it is slightly off but it's not as bad as my pedometers and other tools i have used. i am rather suprised about the battery situation on the sensor and that i cannot recharge it. it appears that i have to buy a new sports kit shortly!",1,99
"a great deal!: i paid only $15.00 for mine and i love it! my husband and i really enjoy a really good cup of coffee. the ease of this machine and way it brews makes for one incredible cup. the only time i have ever had leakage is when i used a new brand of coffee and didn't pack the edges of the filter down all the way.no complaints, only a great taste and lot's of ease making it!",1,79
"massive capacity: this microsd card is great for those music lovers, but find it better to put it on their phone or other device than be hauling an ipod and phone or other. i bought this for my mom's phone and she has alot of songs that last about more or less than 3 min. the storage she has used is not even a tenth off it and has quite a lot songs. recommend for those people with about 500-1,000 songs, not more",1,83
"one of the few essential java books: this is an excellent example of an experienced programmer wanting to impart everything about a subject to the public.this book provides a great introduction and explanation of the complexities of distributed java computing, but it then goes into the deepest aspects aswell.if you have to own any book about java programming this should be in your top 3.also included are great examples that are worked through in the book and technology to test them with the jrun tool (which includes the servlets api) and a web server.",1,94
"not braveheart, but still great!: the first mistake i did when i first saw the patriot, was that i was expecting another braveheart. but this is not braveheart, and it isn't trying to be.roland emmerich really shows that he is a great director who can handle a great script without destroying it with specialeffects. after independence day and godzilla, roland has finally stopped relying on the effects (allthough there are effects, but they do not own the screen at any time) and started to trust his own skills.he also has great help from the cast. mel gibson is great as both the carrying father, and as the cruel buther he is in war. heath ledger is abolutley a name to recon with for the future, and makes the son very well.so all and all this is a graet movie, that does not make all englishmen out to be a sead of evil, that some people have claimed.",1,157
"great sytsem: i've been using this system since 2005 and really like it. though i've learned some things the hard way, like not mounting the wireless sensor directly to a metal surface, i really like the system. it has already saved my house/possessions once. i like it enough to be looking for another two wireless remotes. if anyone has one or more, please email me at jlauren@myadvantageplus.com. also if anyone else is still using the system and needs some remote sensors, email me. i have a few extra. diy jerry",1,90

"samsung syncmaster 930s: i ordered the re manufactured samsung syncmaster 930s to run with another i already had as a duel screen set up. i wanted the same look on both screens so this worked out great. both my old unit and this new one function flawlessly and for the price are great products. the merchant got the screen right to me in good time with no problem.if still available, i would recommend this item for the budget minded user.",1,80
"a must read for our culture!: steve saint's tale of his return to the waodani culture is more than just an individual trying to rectify his past with the culture he has been asked to help. it is a story with many compelling lessons for our current society of growing welfare dependence, creime and violence. and its message applies not only to our domestic policy but to many of our international policies as well. but it does it in a way that is never preachy and is informative and entertaining. it's a quick read (the last two or three chapters are a little too quick; hence four stars instead of five), but it carries a message that can resonate with almost anyone in any culture.",1,125
what fun!: i read a lot of thrillers but wanted something light and funny. that's exactly what i got in this pen for hire. jaine austen was so likeable and i laughed out loud many times. i look forward to reading the next book in the series.,1,47

"a matter of trust: a matter of trust by: anne schraffthe book is mainly about trust. the author's purpose of writing the story is mainly to say to trust people even if you do not want to. the main characters in novel are brisana meeks, darcy wills, and hakeem randall. darcy and hakeem are dating and they think that trust is big factor in a relationship. brisana meeks is a trouble maker who loves to make people angry. my favorite character is darcy because she learned to put her trust in people and let them learn to trust her. she also learned to forgive and forget all the hurtful things people have done to her. you can learn to relate to other people through the things they have been through. i would recommend this book to people who like to read romantic, suspenseful, and comedy books. i would also recommend this book to both male and female teenagers who like to read.",1,162

"very enjoyable and fun movie: i really enjoyed this movie. i seldom watch a movie a 2nd time within 24 hours of seeing it but this one i did. the lead actor was superb in his role, his acting was very good. and michelle rodriguez, i could watch all day, she's great. several of the other soldiers also did a great job of acting. the script in places was sophomoric but some marines and army rangers i knew were just like that in real life. the aliens and their weapons were great, the scenes of a destroyed la was great, and it had a great ending. i look forward to a directors cut with more footage. was it ""gone with the wind"" or something, no it wasn't, but it was still a good movie.",1,134

"""reunion"" live: invited by julian cope to play his ""cornucopea festival"", manuel gottsching recruited former ash ra tempel member klaus schulze to join him. third founding member hartmt enke opted not to participate, so the 2 old friends played together alone. ""gin rose"" is a 69 minute track, constanly evolving. themes heard on ""reunion"" pop up here and there, but as a whole this album struck me as more low key. as with the ""reunion"" album, this sounds like what you would expect if you crossed late 90's klaus schulze with manuel gottsching. reccomended.",1,94
"alla rakha was peerless and still is: what a slice of nirvana from 1968 [recorded in 1967, i believe]! for fans of rich, i am not sure what the appeal would be, but for alla rakha devotees, this is one cd you cannot live without.the packaging is simple, but faithful to the original lp's artwork. all the quality in this one went into the superb mastering work. you feel like the musicians are in the room-and i don't have thousand dollar speakers, folks. five stars on this one.",1,88
king of pop: if you haven't heard this album...where have you been? this is probably one of the best albums made of all time...it has the complete spectrum of musical styles...from romantic ballads to relaxing favorites to dance hits you can't help but move to...all these songs are the cornerstones of the hits today.,1,54

"it lives up to its name.: two brothers (steve zahn and paul walker) on the road incur the wrath of a psycho truck driver, who proceeds to play a deadly game of cat-and-mouse with them. superb thriller is a surprise gem, complete with high-octane suspense and scares. the initially subdued and creepy set-up builds nicely to the last half-hour, a terrifying knockout. kudos to steve zahn for a wonderful performance (he also has good chemistry with paul walker) and to john dahl's taut direction. the film may be a little too elaborate at times with a couple of illogical moments, but you'll be too enthralled to care. enthusiastically recommended.",1,109
"great ozzy at his best!!!!: the first 2 ozzy albuns are great, but for me this is by far the best moment from ozzy...the prince of darkness really bring a great collection of songs on no more tears...the title track is one of the greatest heavy metal songs ever, desire, i don't want to change the world and mama i'm comming home are metal gems!!!! the lyrics are amazing, and ozzy's band really shine on no more tears...great album!!!if you enjoy ozzy osbourne, this is the pinaccle of his legendary solo career!!!bravo, ozzy!!!!",1,93

"exceeded expectations--a great read: not being a fan of the usual election campaign books, i took this up with low expectations. i just wanted to know something about ronald reagan's first campaign for governor. i also suspected that it would be something of a hatchet job on rr. to my pleasant surprise, matthew dallek has produced an engaging--even exciting--narrative that is very well balanced. though he does tend to laud the ""responsible liberalism"" of edmund ""pat"" brown, the democratic incumbent that reagan unseated, he also fairly portrays the new conservatism and ""creative society"" philosophy of ronald reagan and his supporters. i highly recommend this work as essential for understanding the beginnings of the reagan revolution. after this, a good read that bookends the subject is john ehrman's 'the eighties: america in the age of reagan.'",1,135

"don't miss this one: don't you tire of intellectual snobs who resolutely downgrade anything that falls outside their narrow range of appreciation?gustavsen is one of the most exciting young players around, with a schubertian touch that transcends all the classifications of ""bedtime music"", ""piano bar music"" or ""smooth jazz"" that are condescendingly dropped. in fact, the trio are an education.chinese reviewer dayu zhang put it absolutely beautifully. this is a virtuoso performance about timing and melody -- and those who don't understand that slow jazz (like slow blues) is an almost impossibly hard genre to master will just not get this album.excellent sales show that the unbiased and unprejudiced listener will get it -- once again, it is hard to imagine a listener who won't love this.i hope gustaven will follow jan garbarek in providing us with delight for decades to come.highly recommended to all.",1,145

"keep 'em coming!: i now have read all four books by this author, and i think each one is funnier than the last! i am typically not a mystery reader, but a friend gave this series to me as a gift. the soprano includes a mystery, indeed, but the story surrounding it is so hysterical that there were times i laughed so hard that i cried. i don't want to give any of the outrageous moments away, but i recommend this book to anyone who needs a pick-me-up or wants a fun, easy read.",1,94

"the most touching christmas album i've heard: i bought this album based on customer reviews and after listening to the samples. the actual album surpassed my expectations. this is not a collection of christmas carols but a beautiful musical presentation of the christmas story. michael's presentation of 'mary, did you know' is the best i've heard. i've already decided to buy extra copies for christmas gifts. this is the perfect album to listen to when the family is gathered around the christmas tree to remind us all of what christmas is really about.",1,93

"interesting reading: i can't say that this book was anywhere near one of the best true crime books i have ever read, but it did make for some interesting reading. i put off purchasing this book many times because although i like true crime, i am really not enthusiastic about reading stories where innocent babies are murdered, by their own mother nonetheless. it was pitiful the way this woman snuffed out the lives of her innocent children, and for no obvious reason. hard to believe that when her babies were dying one by one in the 1960's, no one thought it peculiar. if this were happening to someone i know now, i would certainly think something was up. this woman makes you very angry. being in her seventies now, her age seems to have played a part in her punishment. i have no pity for her, 27 or 70, it makes no difference. she is a murderer, plain and simple.",1,160

"pure fun!: i'm a fairly recent bnl fan. in fact, i only really got to know their music after the recent ""pinch me"". but i'm very glad i did. the songs are alternately fun and sweet, but they're almost all excellent. even my sister, who only likes old stuff, had to admit that this was a great cd. this cd has all the songs i know and love, such as pinch me, one week, and if i had $1,000,000, plus some truly great ones i've never heard before, such as get in line, and the wizard of magicland. i was slightly disappointed it didn't have ""who needs sleep"", ""some fantastic"" or ""never is enough"" but you can't have everything.i happen to know that this band didn't get famous for being a bunch of pretty boys, like certain other bands i can mention. bnl got famous from pure talent?",1,148

"destined to become a classic (in a relative sense): austin powers will surely become one of the great cultish type comedies of all time. obviously, this is not ""citizen kane"", but it fits in the catagory that holds other classics of my generation like fletch, spinal tap, and monty python's holy grail. there seems to be some sort of gender issue with this movie in that i have yet to meet a woman that likes this movie, but every guy i know loves it. i guess it's a ""guy movie"". i recommend that you see it again...it gets better every time.",1,101
"wants to be just like every other woman: i really enjoyed this novel, you feel for all the main characters: lisa, asha, and ross. this book was written beautifully, and i didn't get confused when they would reminisce to past events. i don't want to give anything thing away, but the betrayal that occurred, makes you think if lisa and ross's marriage was going to last anyway. my favorite character was lisa, and i'm happy she found peace in the end.",1,81

"marty's masterpiece: absolute power and style: the best metal-melodic album of ever!!!! agressive tone, lightning-fast solos, unique exotic and arabesque style are some of the things you'll find inside this record. i specially recommend it to any person who does like instrumental music (focused in guitars)with style. plenty of strenght froma young boy called marty. he hasn't done anything better after this epic lp.",1,64
"a great purchase that helps keep my dog in line!: i bought this gentle leader for my saint bernard that i rescued in march. he has never had prior training and was always pulling on the leash! obviously, because he's such a big dog, his pulling habbits had to stop. my trainer recommended a gentle leader, so i checked amazon.com, of course, and they had exactly what i needed. this thing is definitely an attitude adjuster! when he's wearing the gentle leader, he tends to stick closer to me, and when he does decide to pull, he's quickly stopped by the gentle leader pulling him back to me.this thing is amazing! i recommend it to anyone with any pulling problem with their dog.",1,123

"too bad they're not touring: wow,yot re-released their records? well i don't know about you guys but i had the opportunity to see these guys a bunch of times, the first being back in '87 at fender's. the old schoolers know what venue i'm talking about so i'll leave it at that.this is by far one of the best straight edge punk bands period. ray of today and the crew we're killer on stage with their sing alongs of ""stabbed in the back"" and ""thinking straight"". personally, i was never straight edge, but i did enjoy many a shows from that scene. if you like some hard guitars licks that are accompanied by an equally powerful voice, then you must have this album. break down the walls is, in my opinion, is an album that should be owned by all punks.",1,141
"good read: this book was written to cover united airlines history, but it covers the whole airline industry from the 1920's through 1950. having recently read atlas shrugged, what stood out for me was the government bungling and interference. it's no wonder the airlines are still on taxpayer subsidy!i found the book interesting for the most part (i ended up skipping the statistics paragraphs), and i'm not particularly into airlines.",1,70
"this book is the bible for back pain sufferers - priceless: after $2000 on an mri, the orthepedic doctor said that my chronic pain was ""due to the structures in my back and that the good news was that the pain would go away in 10 to 15 years as they fuse together as you get older"". useless do nothing advice. this book- is amazing, no longer a slave to backpain since 1991. no pain no pain!!!",1,77

"does what it needs to: it's simple and relatively easy to use, digital display for seconds and minutes. the rate at which the numbers change as you rotate the base take a few uses to get adjusted to it, but it's a breeze after that. easy to start, stop, and restart. volume adjustment would be nice, but it's loud and you'll be able to hear it from a room or two over. it's small and blends in. overall, i got what i expected.",1,83
"kilzer is the man!!!: the first song i heard from this album was the radio friendly "" green yellow red"". i rushed out and bought the thing and was blown away. there isn't a weak track to be found. i shortly discovered that they were all radio friendly. my opinion is that you could take any song from this album have a hit. it's a crying shame kilzer never received more acclaim than he did, although he was pretty popular in the little rock/memphis area for a while. not only was he a great song writer and musician, but a very cool dude as well who never turned down a chance to play for anyone. i saw him perform at the pi kappa alpha frat house on the campus of ualr. no band - only a guitar, harmonica, and the man himself, and he is just as good live as in the studio. if you enjoy great stuff with a timeless vibe, this is the album for you.",1,168

"a laid-back mix of accordion, tabla and voice--soulful, cool: gilberto gil has been making music since the mid '60s. i like to think of him as the brazilian paul mccartney: a master melodist, warm singer, and committed pop conceptualist. his influence over today's music has been subtle, but it's hard to imagine arto lindsay, carlinhos brown or tortoise without gil. his last album, ""quanta,"" was good but maybe a little too slick. ""o sol de oslo"" is his most natural-sounding, relaxed record in years. texturally trilok gurtu's percussion adds that certain element of mysticism that has been present in gil's work from the beginning. in fact gil is one of the few pop artists who can combine that ineffable feeling of joy with a finely honed formal beauty. ""o sol"" is immensely enjoyable; it's too bad earlier albums like ""realce"" (1978) and ""refazenda"" (1975) aren't more readily available in the united states, not to mention his groundbreaking ""tropicalist"" work from the swinging sixties.",1,163

"fun to read & great presentation: this book was fun and quite addictive! it contains a collection of unrelated design principles that can be browsed and read in random order. the presentation is very attractive. can be recommended not only to marketers and designers, but also to anybody merely remotely interested in this topic.the weakness is that there is no attempt to create a frame work, overall guidance, or step-by-step advice on how to combine these principles.",1,77
"a gripping, easy-to-read book, but a not light-hearted story: compared to music categories, i would definitely place this book rather in the ""commercial"" genre. but - and that's what i like about it - commercial, easy-to-read with quality.the book deals with the rape and murder of 14-year-old susie salmon and the way her family copes with this loss after her death. on every move of her sister lindsey, her little brother buckley, her parents and her murderer, susie is watching from heaven.there are moments when you will feel tears getting in your eyes, small details that show how much alice sebold knows about the pain and fear she is writing about. if you are looking for a stirring, fine little novel you will not be able to put down easily, go for it. you will not be disappointed.",1,138

"the end of marketing as sergio zyman knows it: 1) internet is missing from the discussion totally. 2) this discussion applies only to broadcast media. 3) there is no discussion of personalization - the necessity of offering actual information. 4) as steve jobs never quite said, what can you expect from a guy who spent his life selling sugar water?",1,60
"finally!!: finally, a wonderful, comprehensive resource to help the average person, who wants to make the change to a healthier lifestyle! i've always felt overwhelmed, with so much conflicting information as to what's safe and what's not. i found out about this book, from the weston a. price website - another awesome resource for finding out the truth. the absolute best part of this book, for me (because, honestly, a lot of the ""chemical"" details are over my head) - are the lists, at the back, of specific products (in each category - hair, face, deoderants etc) that have been tested as absolutely safe. this was so helpful, for me... to have all the research and legwork done, and to be able to simply look up each category, and find out where to buy it. it allowed me to slowly and methodically eliminate my family's personal care products that were harmful and, confidently, replace them with safe ones. the website offers ongoing updates on newly added ""safe"" products. this is an excellent gift.",1,173

"extremely helpful book: i was rear-ended in 2010 just 18 days after i purchased a brand new car. this car immediately lost its value and i was injured in the crash. i could have hired an attorney to settle my claim, but i first wanted to see what it might be worth and how the system worked. this book was extremely helpful. i was able to successfully resolve the property damage claim for a reasonable amount and the bodily injury claim as well all without hiring an attorney. the book has a lot of good advice and sample letters to assist in writing claims and what to do to negotiate or further pursue the claim after the first few settlement offers. this book, along with a lot of patience, was very helpful in my settling my own claim. i'm very glad i purchased it.",1,144
"invaluable guide: my daughter and i used the 9th edition of frommer's tokyo on our recent trip to japan. we found it to be well written, easy to use with very down to earth suggestions. since neither of us had any prior knowledge of tokyo, it was invaluable. we had a most enjoyable week, but we wouldn't have had so many wonderful experiences without this guide.",1,66
"a great book for anyone: coming home to eat is easy to read, enjoyable, and packed full of interesting details on a myriad of topics. this is the type of book you can give to almost anyone, and they will enjoy reading it. i'm a biologist with a background in conservation, and i really enjoyed reading about the natural history of many of the plants and animals in the book. i've given the book to two other people, and they both loved it, but for completely different reasons. one enjoyed all the detailed descriptions of cooking and meals; while the other was more interested by the social and economic aspects of the book. the author does a great job of weaving together several fairly disparate topics into a very entertaining narrative.",1,131

an absolute gorgeous outline of the mind of mary cassatt: i am a teen in a class called e.l.p. (expanded learning program) and we were asked to deeply research an eminent person. i am an adorer of edgar degas and i knew of the relationship he had with mary cassatt. this turned me to do the research on her. i bought this book at the chicago art institue when i toured her work. this gives a great description of the wonderful women behind this artwork that she creates. i believe she should be more emphisized when people think of art. this book really explains who she is. it is a must read!,1,112
"a bit pricey, but it works as advertised: i have no complaints. the heat dissipation is fine, even better than when the laptop is on a wooden or plastic table. i love the velvet padding. it is not an ergonomical substitute for actually working on a desk with a mouse, but i found extremely comfortable when browsing/working on a couch (preferably with elevated leg rest). not certain that it is worth the price. overall, i recommend it.",1,77
"good: this cd is good. it is heavy and energetic yet still has some good melodies. the lyrics are a little ridiculous, but what do you expect from a band called demon hunter? so all in all, i like it...",1,40
"well's second best book: although i thoroughly enjoyed the book, it will never match my favorite of his 'the island of doctor moreau.'

"great traditional ricemaker: this is the fourthe ricemaker we have owned and i did quite a bit of research before purchasing it. i didn't want lots of extra ""bells and whistles"" - just a good solid rice maker and that is exactly what this is - it makes great white or brown rice in a short amount of time and can also steam veggies in a convenient tray on top at the same time. it cleans up easily - goes easily in the dishwasher. my only complaint is that for the first couple of times you use it it sprays quite a bit of steamy water around the edges - but that stops after the third use.",1,117
"bambi..one of the classics: me and my husband picked this up for my 22 month old daughter. the newly enhanced color was great..but i found the film still to be a bit dark compared to the cartoons of today. i know, i know they did what they could and in these times cartoons have come a long way. my daughter might be a tad young for this because she seemed to lose interest alot. i think once she gets older she will enjoy it more. it still was a great investment in a wonderful disney classic.",1,96

"definitely worth it: the only downside to this radar detector is to set the compass. you will need a retail store parking lot (empty) to drive in circles (3 times) to set the compass. after that the radar detector is such a beauty. it will detect all the bands specified in the description, i know it for a fact. it will detect a speed radars about a mile and a half away in any direction. in open highway it will go as far as 2 1/2 miles. this product has definitly saved me from several tickets.",1,96
"fantastic and outstanding cd by frankie ford: frankie ford is an icon and a fantastic entertainer. he should have been into the rock and roll hall of fame long before now. the big boys at the hall of fame they usually recognize the big stars when they are long gone and are not here anymore to share in their achievements. with frankie's new cd ""that can be used again"" it is a work of art. frankie recorded two of my songs i wrote.

"fantastic!: excellent so far - i have only begun reading it, but it is very good and i know will continue to be based upon the author and his experience. highly recommended to any serious strength/bodybuilding athlete.",1,37
"it has its place: there are really 2 books that are sold seperately( they don't tell you that). the first big book is like the first semester and the second is the second semester. the tapes are sold separately too, and you need them.this book gives you sentences and has words but if you are new to arabic this is not the place to start. it has the words that will be covered in a sentence and the constructs the sentences in every possible way.ex. i want a book, she wants a book, he wants a book, they want a book she wants him to have a book. ect.it is a good book if you already have a good basic understanding of the arabic and its grammer otherwise leave this one alone, and learn from another book and practice with this one.",1,142
lots of fun for babies to see the spots disappear!: got this for my one year old grandson and he loves to wash them off and see the spots disappear and then when they are dry they come back. different bath tub toy from the usual!,1,46
"used as sensory motor activity: i am a pediatric occupational therapist who uses this book during our summer program. we use a different theme every week with the children and during our camping week, i use this to make an obstacle course to go along with the book. first use a holla hop hung from the ceiling with streamers hanging from it for the grass. balance beam over the blue paper to be the river. half moon rubber like disks to simulate the squelchy mud. make a forest of trees to stumble trip thru. use a bubble machine to go thru the whirling snowstorm and at last get to the dark cave they crawl into and find the bear.this is such a fun book both my boys loved when growing up! i continue to love the book and use it as a great sensory motor activity for the children as they venture thru the story themseleves.melissa evans",1,157
"love this workout!: i started with the ultimate collection and moved to doing this one 3 times a week, as this uses hand weights, the waist belt and the stretchie. it is a very good, fast paced workout.i'm seeing great results with leslie's workouts! these are so easy to do, and the time just flies by. i've been dropping lots of pounds and inches rotating workouts so i do 4-5 miles 5 days a week.thank you leslie!!!4/17/12 update: netflix has this now, so you can try it out and see if you like it. i still love it!",1,98
good for defensive play.: speed: this paddle is a bit on the slow side.control: the control is excellent.spin: spin is medium.i think this is a good beginners paddle for those who don't rely too much on spin.,1,37
"beautiful frame: this frame has just enough detail, and doesn't distract from what it's framing. the canvas liner is a great alternative to matting, and it comes with two different options for mounting on the wall.",1,36
"i really like it: but now that i'm 12 i had to find another book and ask my mom for more stuff, because this book doesn't address sex at all. it's okay for eight-year-olds, or younger if you develop earlier. it could have more info on stuff like anorexia, because i was sort of interested in that. it never said anything about boys, or lesbians, or how babies are made. otherwise, it was good. they should make an older girls' one.i'm only 12 and at my school i've already kissed boys and my friend got drunk one time and they could have said more about this.",1,106
great tape: i purchased this for work. it's easy to tear off strips but a really good tape. great for taping wires or cables to a wall or floor.,1,29
"this movie is how all movies should be set.: this movie is pure fantasy. put it in your vcr and be taken away to another, almost, surrealistic place. while the story itself could be polished there was enough here to make it a favorite. each actor did a really great job at epitomizing what their character stood for. however, i think the writer could have had made them more dynamic. i agree that it did end too soon without resolution. but isn't that the point...the longing? all in all, a beautifully set movie with an excellent soundtrack and terrific cast makes it worth the price of admission.",1,107
"easy to understand: persoanlly, i really like this book and use it all the time. it is easy to understand and helps me feel more confident with my personal grading practice. the only thing i don't like is that the pictures are not the greatest but this hasn't really been a problem for me. in short, if you want to grade better then get the book. the sub-par pictures aren't enough to detract too much.",1,75
"one of the best books i've ever read: i loved the book. i'm not a big reader. i hate reading but this book was good. i never could find a good book until aquamariane and indigo. i think you sould read it. and or buy it. well thats my opinon.but then, i don't know yours. have a nice day!!!!!!!!!!!!",1,59
"can't believe no one has reviewed this yet!: i bought this album as it featured constantly in critics fave lists over the years (especially remember reading about dreamer in a desert island collection by australian music critic stuart coupe in an ex-girlfriend's magazine one lazy afternoon). bobby sings like no-one else. he has this growl that at first seems out of place - it's so unexpected. but he puts such feeling into building up each tune - no song of his starts on high emotion - bobby likes the slow burn, you dig? when i play his music for my friends they think it's someone having a laugh - sort of like comedian lenny henry doing his theo t wildebeast routine (especially going by the photos in the jacket too - they're in a classic pimp style). but to true lovers of soul you can tell that mr bland is the real thing. defintitely worth a listen.",1,157
"i was there: ok, i am on my way to buy this dvd, but i must tell you i was actually at this show....i'd known a grand total of four boc songs, but that didn't take away from the enjoyment at all. it was a fantastic show that was energetic, electric, and mystifying. their lead guitar player shredded up navy pier, he was that good. i highly reccommend this dvd because the show was an absolutely spectacular one that i will never forget. you might even see me there! peace out and, please, let the girl rock and roll.",1,99
grandson: my grandson has been very pleased with his purchase. we received the product in a very timely matter. thank you a greatful grandmother.,1,24
im addicted!: best and funnest album of the year by far!!! i am addicted to it. i hum it all day at school and i cant wait to get home so i can blast it and dance. :),1,38
"a beautiful item: this is a beautiful item. the copper and brass together make this an interesting paper towel holder for any kitchen. the base is made of copper and is not as substantial as i would have liked it to be, but the weights that attach to the base make it quite stable.the paper towels pull off the roll easily and the bar makes it easy to only get the amount of paper towel that you want.this item blends beautifully with other copper kitchen items and has given my kitchen a proffesional look. i quite happy with it and proud of the way it looks in my kitchen.",1,109
"korn??? i'm hungary but i don't see any korn!: i think this album is pretty good, but too much rapping! i really liked that todd mcfarlane did the cover and the ""freak on a leash"" video. wanna see more of his artwork??? buy a spawn comic book, it's really cool. this album rocks and anyone that likes metal or likes their older stuff then buy this album.",1,67
"a must-read for all aspiring mt's to be. very informative.: this is a book written by a man who clearly loves his career as a medical transcriptionist. i found it to be downright funny at times, but most of all simply written and and containing just about all the information an aspiring medical transcriptionist would need to get started in his/her new career. the author even included his e-mail address in the book. i e-mailed him a question about schooling, and he very kindly replied by the following day with very good advice for me.",1,95
"best group album ever, best wu album ever: only track i skip is black shampoo, other than that this album is dazzling and there is no filler. they took their time and came up with a classic, what all artists should do.",1,42
helped a beginner: bought this book for my daughter who is a beginner and she caught on to playing within the next week...very helpful,1,24
good christian movie: the theme is like the prodigal son. this movie portrays in a real life situation hhow god always is willing to take us back. a story of redemption.,1,31
great wagon for two riders: we bought this wagon because we wanted one with seat belts. our daughter just loves to ride with her cousins or a favorite doll. we even loaded it with toys and wheeled her around the house when we were moving and she had a great time!,1,51
"excellent resource: this dvd is packed with amazing information about the imagery and messages behind popular music, and how they tie into the popular worldview today, which is basically anti christianity at its core. the truth is undeniable, and is presented in a concise, and ordered way that is easy to understand. it covers a wide range of topics, very comprehensive. i am so greateful for this resource, and have watched it thru, all 6 hours of it, several times. highly reccomended!",1,82
"hooked on russell watson, fresh and unique: i have read some of the negative reviews written here and have decided that quite a few of them must have been written by the same reviewer (same wording and same repetitious phrases and terminology). you've made your point but if you will read the rest of the reviews, you'll find that you are certainly in the minority, so enough already! i found the musical arrangements wonderful and russell's renditions of core'ngrato, recondita armonia and vesti la giubba....perfection!! i do, however, agree that it's time for him to rest his voice before he does his 4th cd. 3 cd's in such a short amount of time plus all the promotional trips and personal performances certainly must play havoc on an entertainer's voice. i consider him to be a rare performer with a beautiful, powerful voice that is always ""on key"", such feeling he projects and such a nice demeanor with his audiance. wishing you much success in the future. a real fan!!",1,169
"el proyecto post king kobra de mark free.: sin duda alguna el album que demuestra la gran calidad de mark free como cantante, esta agrupacion nace a partir de la reunion de mark con erik scott, (tambien participa jan uvena a la bateria, ex-alkatrazz), y bajo la produccion de kevin elson (journey, mr. big), lo cual redondea una gran obra que va de canciones pegadizas ""arms of a stranger"", ""does it feel like love"" y baladas incomparables ""this love, this time"", en realidad es un disco muy parejo en cuanto a canciones e interpretacion, lo cual hace que sea muy disfrutable aun desde la primera escucha, mas cercano al ""thrill of a lifetime"" de king kobra, para fans de journey, king kobra, mr. big, y del sonido de finales de la decada de los 80 este sera sin duda un gran disco para agregarlo a su coleccion.",1,147
"great talent put into this cd: i started liking phish awhile ago, it all started when i was browsing through a catalog, then i saw a page of phish...i never heard of phish at that time so i went and listened to a sample, it was great so i got a couple of the cds and was grooving to that, i love this album, it's one of the best ones they made, suprisingly i noticed how similiar they are to the grateful dead. i love the grateful dead but phish might not be a better singing group then grateful dead but soon they will be bigger then woodstock! long live phish!!!",1,111
"a good guide: i purchased copies of this for our property owner's association as we are required to follow these rules. as a volunteer group many persons were unfamiliar with this system.robert's rules is rather complicated for smaller associations as it was created for corporations so much does not apply to us, but this version gives us a easier way to apply it to our system for board members.i was pleased that we have not had to wade through the entire original book to apply the correct operational system to our group meetings.with all that said it is still rather involved but doable.",1,103
a thousand kisses deep: makes a perfect gift for yourself or that special person.botti's music is moving. a thousand kisses deep is onepiece where botti seduces the audience with the perfecttone and extraoridinary tunes of his saxophone.,1,37
"10+ stars: this cd is great. i especially like the song ""layne"". if you are a alice in chains fan, you would love this song. i think that it is great. the entire cd has such a great sound to it. you have to go out and buy it. it is definitely worth it!! a+++++++++",1,55
"classis... while the author is alive!: the music on this cd is of tramendous both musical and sound quality. every time i listen to ""journeyman"", i want more of comparable quality, and that is hard to find!",1,37
tasty dried berries.: bought these twice now. are really good and good for you. different than what you might be used to but i eat them by the handful or put in my cereal. loaded with antioxidants. recommend you give them a try.,1,43
"bruce is so goooooooood!, matthew not bad either: i absolutely loved this movie. perry is at his funniest and bruce is just too cool.",1,24
value for your money: i have been searching for the docking station in other stores and this was by far the best value. i have been using it for a few weeks now and it has been very practical. i recomend it.,1,42
"a valuable resource with hard to find information: when i began to study hoodoo, i was on the lucky mojo site alot. that's where i found out about this book. i was really looking for comprehensive and hard to find information about how herbs are used in hoodoo.and i was delighted! this is a terrific resource. the book is organized alphabetically by herb. along with it is a valuable cross-reference of common folk names for herbs. so many herbs i had been reading about, turns out i can get them at the bulk section of the health food store!yronwode also gives recipes, formulas, and much other magical information in the book. it is jam packed with so much information, i read it for 5 days straight.i would recommend this to anyone interested in the magical use of herbs, not just hoodoo practitioners. i believe anyone can benefit from learning the folk use of these herbs, whether you practice hoodoo, wicca, shamanism, or a mix of whatever. it broadens your understanding of the plants tremendously.",1,174
"if you bake bread, this is your mixer!: this is an amazing workhorse of a mixer. i bake bread weekly and this makes easy work of it. i use a 7 cup of flour recipe and no longer need to kneed by hand. the only thing i would change is the aluminium hook & paddle as they are not machine washable.",1,61
"not the best writing but good history: although i think this book suffers from both an uneasy writing hand and some grim, soldierly editing, it is nonetheless good history. once you get used to the (odd) style, you can follow an authoritative account of the u.s. third army through its training days and then its arrival in the european theatre, with the spectacular results that ensued. it is, as it should be, a rollicking sort of book, that recounts the events in mannish fashion. it's quick and (relatively) easy to read and adds something to our knowledge of this american hero of the second world war who, had he had his way, might have started a third immediately! four stars because it's worth reading.",1,124
"great airplane photog book: mr english brings out some very good points with this book. i read the book and have found myself taking his tips, pointers, and suggestions and using them without even thinking about it. i have been doing air-air photography for 2 years now, it's not easy, but it sure is rewarding. i would highly recommend that if anyone is considering taking airplane photos that they read this book.",1,72
good substitute for a full blown trans jack at a fraction of the cost: fit the jack the i was using and performed very well with a heavy truck transmission with a transfer case attached. other than the chain that was to short for the job this tool did a great job on that big trans. made the job very easy after i added some extra chain. would recommend this adapter to anyone that has the knowledge to do the work,1,81
"nice album, great band: well lets pu it this way, they are not very known in the world but that makes it even better. their music is pure punk rock, which i love. if you're a fan of rufio, millencolin, sum 41, pennywise, etc you should get an album from these fellows. just listen to the song called 'jackie chan's army' mi6 is definetely a great punk rock band.-- andrés",1,70
"great book for kids: there are several books in this series, each cut to the shape of the state! the books have a lot trivia about each state and are fun for kids and the adult reading with them. wish there were all 50 books in the series!",1,48
a must have!: wonderful facts and great drawings! excellent natural history information. great fun for children of all ages.,1,19
"homeschooling: the middle years: this is a very informative book especially for first-time homeschoolers. it was well written and very well organized. the resources listed were very helpful.my only complaint was the unnecessary criticism of classroom teachers. unless ms. henry was once a classroom teacher herself, i feel she is unqualified to claim that ""the most average high school graduate could produce average work in this not-so-challenging college major."" i was disappointed in this display of subjective writing in an otherwise well-written book.",1,83
"great product, fast shipping: what a cute item! this is my dog's second one, she is just destructive and it only lasted second before she cracked the musical component...but i'll probably order another one for next year. she just loves it! the look on her face when it plays the music instead of the typical sqeaking toy noise is just too cute to pass up!thanks!!!",1,65
"perfect in its own little nifty way: shanghai knights is an interesting movie. of course it could have been better....but come on, it could have been worse. i personally thought it was a great movie! it had humor, sword fights, fist fights, and great actors. now, this movie made me a huge fan of aidan gillen-he's great as lord rathbone. of course jackie chan and owen wilson are spectacular too- as are the secondary characters. see this movie. it's a great movie!!(((the dvd extras are amazing: deleted scenes, audio commentary from the director and screen writers, a music video entitled ""action overload"" featuring all the fight scenes, and a ""fight manual"" with jackie chan and the director(david dobkin)...all in all...the dvd is a great buy)))",1,125
"wowwwwwwwwwww!!!!!!: i loved this book! it is really good. all of lemony snicket's books are good, but starting at five, they get reeally good! i would definitley recomend this book. it is full of adventure, and suspense. read the austere acadamy today!!!!!!!",1,42
heelllooo: you guys got the pictures for the dachshound and lab switched!it makes it kinda confusing for people who want the lab game...which would i get if i ordered it!?which is right the words or the pictures?,1,37
"heavy as hell.: i really think someone needs to set the record straight about this band. i have read many reviews for this cd, i dont thinkreviewers are even listening to the cd.this band does not sound like killswitch engage.many people have compared them to killswitch because of the clean vocals, caliban has been around just as long as killswitch and always used clean vocals. howerver, caliban does not use clean vocals nearly as much killswitch, and also caliban's music is much heavier and far less accessible. this is a very go for the throat style of metalcore. check is out if you like... on broken wings,blood has been shed, unearth, etc..",1,112
"fantastic cartoon, but...: i really liked the animation in this movie, and was really blown away by all the cartoons.the blue navajos were amazing, and the screeching bird flyers sounded and looked real. i also liked how the environment looked alive, like every milky strand of flarnsdroppers and cranstrappers was a conscious, sentient, non-cartoon.however... (i write in caps for emphasis.)after seeing this movie, i read a book. it had a plot and characters. and while i read it, i thought. i give the book i read 4 out of 5 stars -- minus one star because it didn't have cool-looking cartoons in it. but it had other stuff.in conclusion, i recommend books.",1,112
great history unveiled: i have almost finished this book and it is an easy read and very informative. i was never taught a fraction of what is in this book concerning the french revolution and the reign of terror. the young should be taught true history. the author portrays the evil of this time and it compares with the nazis actions and the evils of the russian revolution. i know we have been allies of france in many wars but to bury the atrocities of history because of this is wrong. it was a time and an evil that gripped a people and has been repeated through out history. evil is not characteristic to one group or nation. god bless the catholic martyrs of the french revolution. we could learn much from the way they lived and died for their catholic beliefs.,1,142
"two thumbs upward for the downward spiral: okay, i don't necessarily buy into all of trent reznor's lyrics (""god is dead, and no one cares...""), but poetry aside, this album deserved all of the critical acclaim it received. the nine inch nail composed what i consider to be one of the best albums of the 1990's, and reznor shows that industrial music is not just out there to be danced to. nine inch nails uses a superb mixture of high-reverb guitars, keyboards, sound effects and beats to portray a spectrum of emotional highs and lows compressed into a flow which i feel is on par with pink floyd's ""dark side of the moon."" reznor packs a hard and noisy whallop on the first half of the album which reaches a climax with the song ""big man with a gun"". after this, things slow down dramatically until the final song ""hurt"" hits you with one big, depressing knockout punch. the feeling conveyed on ""the downward spiral"" is phenomenal, and it's a must-buy for alternative and hard-rock junkies alike.",1,177
"awesome book about paul: wow - when i finished reading this book, i felt like i had been right there with the apostle paul through all of his missionary journeys, trials, and triumphs! i felt like paul was my close and personal friend! the author takes the basic historical facts and truths about paul and weaves a story around it. it made me want to get out my bible and read acts and other pauline epistles. (which i did...) although this book is long, please don't let that intimidate you. it is worth the read!",1,95
"a must for first-time parents: as a first time mom, i quickly ran out of ideas of what to feed my thirteen-month-old. this book has saved my life! recipes include old standbys such as meatloaf (with tons of interesting variations) and more surprising recipes such as broccoli quiche and spinach pie. in the last three days, i've made eight recipes, and my previously finicky toddler has gobbled them up!true, for adult palates, some recipes lack salt, but are quite flavorful otherwise.a must!",1,82
"it works: this is a great filter for use in b&w photography, it really punches up blue skys in images.",1,20
"excellent book!...: this was an excellent book. it revealed everything that happens on the streets and in the drug game. the book kept your attention from cover to cover. it was definitely a 5 star book. i am an unpublished author, and reading books is my inspiration for writing. this book inspired me to write what i feel and not to hold back anything. i congratulate her, and meow meow productions. be sure to read the book by shannon holmes, called : b-more careful. an excellent book indeed.",1,88
harryhousewife: i always wanted pfaltzgraff dishes. after shopping everywhere amazon had the best price with the $25 special discount offered at that time. i love these dishes. they're classic and elegant.,1,31
illusions made simple: this is a lovely book with perfectionist descriptions of every step and preventative measures to insure the most amazing results. the method is exceptionally simple strip piecing but the book is a font of additional information that will increase your skills. the author breaks down each step to the minutia and cuts off any common made mistakes.,1,60
for my nephew : ): when a child wants to read - you must provide. it was suitable and keeps his interests. thanks!,1,23
the best series: the thrilling series has finally come to dvd. i didn't start watching till the end so it's great to see how it all began.,1,27
"belonging to the ages: the author writes with a strong awareness of her surroundings. seemingly acquainted with the shadow self, ms. fogarty stands in her own truth ready to help others appreciate the challenges, opportunities and possibilities that come with diversity.i enjoyed passions for its unique insights and ability to empower others.a super collection of prose and poetry that invites sassy, saucy teachers, mentors and guides of their community to reignite curiosty in others with a persistent, knowing voice.",1,79
"roselynde: after reading book 1, i very quickly ordered the next three in the series because this one was so enjoyable.",1,21
another crichton thriller: i like his books b/c they combine cutting edge techno-concepts into a thriller you can't put dowm.this is another great example of the same.,1,27
"good new old-fashioned country: a stunning album that will appeal to anyone who likes good music - not just country.the only thing that stops me giving this 5 stars is the final track - lyrically not great.aside from that, kasey's voice is beautiful - almost childlike, blending wonderfully with julie miller's harmonies on the captain. other highlights are the upbeat cry like a baby and the lilting, haunting ballad 'these pines'.",1,71
"wow, great action, and a plot with a soul: finally got around watching this kung-fu flick -- supposedly jet's last martial arts film. it's never fair to compare jet li's hard-boiled ballet-like shaolin kicks with bruce lee's no-bs brute-force chops, and both movies are extremely entertaining each in its own ways. ""fearless"" features great jet li kung-fu action, yet it also has a ""soul,"" so to speak: the plot reveals the frustrations and dejections of a people beaten down by foreign ""devils,"" and a populace yearning to regain its lost respect and past glory. it's surprising to this viewer that the portrayal of the japanese fighter is very sympathetic, unlike bruce lee's or other chinese-vs.-japanese fist-fight films. the special effects are rather superfluous but overall does not hurt the film's imagery or flow. a really entertaining and enjoyable movie, indeed.",1,140
"damn right they call him bruce: this was the best movie ever, i laughed so hard i cryed and i cryed so hard i laughed. if you hate good movies then stay far away from this masterpeice. why is it so good?? maybe you havent seen a crazy chinese guy eat noodles with nunchucks, but i, oh yes, i have. in closing.... thats all i have to say.",1,68
love this tv series: i hate that this tv series didn't stay on the air longer. it has a great story line with lots of drama and action. it is also a get show to watch and learn about things you might want to stock up on in case of a horrible national disaster.,1,54
"jim dandy amp cover: no problems. fits the amp perfectly, and appears to be tough. has no padding, so don't expect a lot of protection. it's mainly a dust cover.",1,30
"works great: checked out the other reviews. as instructions state, don't overfill and you'll be fine be fine with the oil storage.entire assembly comes apart pretty easy for cleaning.received mine with a small dent in the side but was not work the hassle to send back. used it 3-4 times so far and works great. the cover helps keep oil from splashing but does store some condensation that drips into oil. oil storage is a great idea.cons:storage container design should take into consideration for some extra oil.this would help with most negative reviews and oil spills.",1,96
"close: this almost does what i want it too. i bought this as a replacement for a gps v - a very good gps mapping system in its own right. i require a larger memory capacity, and a larger screen, so i got it here. the color screen is much easier to read. the 128 mb card and usb programmer are wonderful, and provide me with a set of maps for nearly all of my trips without having to hook up the unit to the computer for an hour or more for a half day's worth of maps.it has a couple of flaws, the mount isn't perfect, so if the car vibrates, then the gps does too. the gps v, didn't have this problem, it was rock solid. nor can i alter the fields that are displayed in map navigation mode - the gps v would allow me to change the fields, so i had miles to go until the destination - now i have to switch to the directions page for that.",1,173
"cadette color wave lip tint: this is the only lip tint i have been able to find, that is truly what it says it is, ""lip tint"". i love it, it's lite, no heavy build up, not sticky, leaves my lips moist and shiny with just enough color. it gets 5 stars from me.",1,54
"good product: exactly what i was looking for in speaker mounts. they are small and discreet and function as designed. considering the price, they are more than i thought they would be!",1,32
"love and war: this book was excellent. every short story in the book involves love of some kind, love of heroes, love of poor good souled people. it also talks about the great huma, and tells how he destroyed the queen of darkness: and his love for the silver dragon he rode, and when transformed , a beautiful woman. every tale is just magnificent. raistlins daughter was not as good as i thought it could be , but , it was still a very good tale. buy this book , it's a must for dragonlance fans.",1,96

works like a charm: i got this for a christmas present and couldn't resist trying it early. it is terrific! i made a mug of coffee and it was hot and there was no bitterness. i will probably try to find the # 1 filters but just for ease of clean up. because i made only a mug i cut back on the grounds and there was no problem with overflowing into the cup. this is a great product and i would definitely give it as a gift.,1,88
"an excellent resource for both the expert and novice: roberts takes the census and breaks it down into relevant and meaningful data. using charts, maps, and other helpful images, he brings the reader into the diverse and complex information garnered from the u.s. census. you'll find yourself quoting many of the compelling statistics given by roberts.",1,56
"needed perspective for a programmer: want to write a brilliant applicatioin? then think and process information the way your user will think and process, and design your application for them, not you! easy concept to say and comprehend, but rather hard to actually do. tog, through examples and descriptions, tells us how people think and process information. the not-so-surprising thing is that most code slingers think in conceptual ways that are not so common. go figure. tog really does help you understand how most others will process, and that understanding makes you a better developer.my company makes these chapters on processing information a required reading for all new developers that join the company. it is that good. the intuition quiz, the one that tries to help you see how your own brain stores and retrieves information, is an addiction for every new reader. of course, one of the coded sayings ""9 p in the ss"" is dated. today it should be written ""8 p in the ss"". tomorrow it may change again.",1,172
"amazingly lifelike: i grew up in a diabetic household so i have always been aware of the difference between ""people"" food and ""diabetic"" food. of course it was only recently that i was put on the non-people stuff exclusively.these candies are surprisingly satisfying. i have a doc who says artificial sweeteners are for those who haven't yet admitted that they aren't allowed to have a sweet tooth any longer. may be true but these little candies are quite nice.they are, in fact, hard. that is a nice change from diabetic candies when i was a child. they have a decent mouth feel and an almost caramel taste. i don't catch an aftertaste. so, when i ""need"" a fix, these are nice to have around the house. won't mistake them for ""people"" candy but these really are amazingly lifelike.",1,138
"we'll miss you zachary...: i first heard zb on the local 'smooth jazz' station back in '96 or so. it naturally stood out strongly because it is not smooth jazz, or at least what i think of as smooth jazz. peter white is smooth jazz, with boring drum machines, limited tone, and just plain fluff. zb represents the long lineage of fine true jazz guitarists that came before him, from charlie christian through wes montgomery and grant green, then george benson, and now with the likes of chris standring and norman brown. this is real music, with soul and punch, and great variety of moods on one disc. it's worth every penny. i also have laidback and groovin' (which i found in a tucson used music store in '99, after searching for a copy for 6 months...) they are both wonderful, full of passion, with a little bit of an edge. this music will keep you smiling.",1,157

"a smart film for discerning viewers: this film is not for the squeemish or those with short attention spans and trouble reading english subtitles. this is not a conventional war movie nor does it pretend to be. this is well written, brilliantly acted, wwii revenge fantasy. those expecting a standard morality play with white-hatted good guys or a non-stop shoot-em-up action romp will be sorely disappointed. those who appreciate a clever story, snappy dialogue (and lots of it), and some very brief scenes of fairly graphic war violence will be thrilled.",1,91
nerf is good: this gun was over all great but after getting it a few days ago i ran into some problems with the ammo. this happened when i was shooting it with my maverick but i got some ammo mixed up and this gun is so picky about ammo that when i used it again it would only shoot one of the three darts that it came with.,1,69
"one of the best albums ever!: after such a great first album, i was worried about their sophomore album not living up to my expectations, but i'm happy to say that they far exceeded them. this is one of the best christian albums i have ever heard. every song is full of spiritual vision and power, very uplifting. i have listened to this album non-stop since i purchased it and i'm still not tired of it.",1,76
"this is the one!: if you haven't purchased anything by elmore james, this is the place to start. some of his best music, recorded well and full of the intense energy he was famous for.screaming slide guitar put to a rockin' beat.some may say it lacks the ""hits"" you find on every other james disc, but it doesn't matter, because the songs on this are all excellent! listen to his vocals on ""happy home"". easily among his top performances. play it loud! rocking blues at it's best.",1,87
lupine dog collar: i bought this collar to replace another lupine dog collar that was getting to small for my 6 month old blue heeler. she's black and white and the color looks so pretty on her. the collars are very sturdy and well made.,1,45
"what truly happened behind the scenes: state of war: the secret history of the cia and the bush administration, written by james risen, describes in details the mistakes that were made in a time of crisis. not much is known though on how liable the sources james risen uses are, since they were kept confidential for various reasons. most of the blame is placed upon the secretary of defense donald rumsfeld and cia director george tenet; however, some blame is also placed on president george bush. personally i believe that this shouldn't be and even after reading james risen's book i still believe that. yes it outlines crucial mistakes that were made, but with the knowledge the president had at the time of his decision, those choices were the most suitable.",1,131
"great stuff!!: these are great for a complete home workout. i order red, blue and purple.i go to the gym too. days when i don't have time for gym, or i'm traveling, i use these for my workout and get a good pump.items were delivered fast and in great condition. would definitely recommend.stay fit!! stay alive!!",1,56
great find!: i really love this book. it helps you to realize your own doll possibilities. it gives enough instruction for those of us who just want the process needed to get what we want done.,1,36
"incredible epic ""kids"" show - who wouldn't love it?: we don't have cable, so my daughter stumbled upon this at grandma's house. and then she got the first two (individual) dvds of season one. i am hooked! the animation is superb! and the fight/bending sequences are pretty amazing for a kids show. i'm limited, but when aang was in zuko's quarter's (episode 2) and when aang fought is old friend (episode 5) were fantasticly animted. and the voice acting puts it even higher.what isn't mentioned much here is the music. it adds such an element to the show. it is simple, sometimes just acapella, but it is spot on and cleverly edited.my dvds are very blurry, which i see is common here. i hope, pray, wish that they re-release it with a better version. i am conflicted because i want to give 2 stars for the product. but the show is worth more than 5, and that is what people here want to know - if the show is good.love this show!",1,172
worth the money: this is a typical amanda quick novel. only a few of her books did i not throughly enjoy. the paid companion was an excellent and enjoyable read.,1,30
"may be without feathers, but its with humor: without feathers, by woody allen, is a witty humorous book with 15 or so short essays/stories on a variety of topics. the humor here is very funny and not dated at all. you most pay close attention as the one-liners fly off the pages. simply hilarious stuff. hard to believe this was released in 1975.a recommended 4 star effort!",1,67

"the best concept album in rock history: pink floyd second best album (1. dark side of the moon) the wall is musically, lirically awesome. for me this is by far the best concept album, some people say sgt pepper. what!! they are just couple of songs without coherence. waters created an excellent concept with great music with little help from gilmour.",1,61
"a painful, harrowing, beautifully written book: i read this book when i was 15, and i never forgot it. it's a story of a 14 year old boy, living a cruel existance in a mental hospital and trying to make sense of the insanity of his life and others around him, and the inhumanity he suffers at the hands of those whom a child should be able to trust most.we understand his thinking, we are angry for him, and we want to reach into his nightmare of a life and pull him out. there are no happy endings here, he does not walk off into a fake sunset...but the book is written with an honesty and beauty that is not easily forgotten. i am 45 and have recently acquired a copy and it's just as gripping and touching now as it was then. (whoever gave this book only one star missed the point entirely...)",1,154

"food production systems: i grew up on a farm, but had not had a garden in 25 years, so my skills were a little rusty. after becoming acquainted with marjorie's food production systems, i once again tackled a garden in my yard. i started small, 8 x 16, and then enlarged the next year to 16 x 16. with the dvd, and a few basic tools and a willingness to work, i have been able to produce numerous spring and fall crops that we enjoy, and share with neighbors. i think this dvd series is an excellent tool for anyone, novice or pro. it is easy to understand and apply what marjorie teaches. good stuff!",1,115
make great gift: i got one on sale for $10. received it today and immediate want to order 10 more but price has gone up. every piece is classy looking. this is one of the very few items that amazon did not inflate the 'suggested retail price'. worth $40 in my opionion.,1,52
"motogear arge scooter cover: i received this product a couple of weeks back and was quite suprised with the price and quality of the item. i ordered 2 because my partner and myself recently purchased a couple of scooters. the price inc postage to australia was amazing, worked out to around $20aud each, compared to the local price of $65 each. we have has some serious rain here in melbourne australia and this product has held it own in the weather. i wouldnt say 100% water proof but does hold up real well in very heavy rain. great quality and hold clips keeps everything ticked in and well enclosed. i would recommend this product for anyone looking for additional protection for their scooter.",1,123
"not for the faint of heart!!!: i first heard about this cd in a review on npr. the snippets they played interested me enough to seek out an purchase it.while i like her messages, and her style, i found this cd very difficult to listen to! i was in the throes of trying to end a most tumultous relationship, and every single song (except ""jolene"") had me bawling my eyes out!!! it's been almost two years, and i still can't listen to 'one moment more' and have dry eyes by the end!! maybe that speaks more to me and my fragility, but no other music has quite that effect on me.i loved the duet with dolly, though! that's the best song on the cd!",1,124
perfect: this coffee maker travels with me everywhere. it is well made and the extra shot a great hidden gem. buy it!,1,22
"seems to work well, static if left on all the time?: seems to be a quality product and has worked well for me. i had been leaving it on all the time, and the transmitter gets hot. i also noticed i would get some random loud static on occasion. turning it on only when i'm going to use it does seem to prevent this (so far), but is somewhat inconvenient.",1,70

"ronnie was and remains great!: this particular album is a wonderful stroll down memory lane. milsap's voice was so smooth, so strong and so recognizable. his arrangements are beautifully done. for lovers of pop, soft rock,country, or just ronnie milsap fans, this is a wonderful purchase and makes a great gift.",1,51
"invincible? not really. but still better than anyone else: once you pop in the invincible cd you hate to take it out. listening to other albums becomes a sin almost. it is that good. notice i say good, not ""invincible"". a couple of the songs, namely break of dawn and 2000 watts, just don't fit with the album. however the other 14 tracks more thatn make up for it. the first three tracks just scream to be released to the radio. i don't think that mike has had a better opening since ""off the wall"". throw that in with the mindblowing ""heaven can wait"" and you wonder why mike just doesnt release the whole album. maybe the doesnt quite live up to mikes standards, but this is the best r&b album to be released in the last 5 yrs.",1,139
photomax: i took some pics today they were clear and perfect i like this camera alot and i bought it from amazon in 2000 and it has a great look,1,30
"the best oop for java book i've read so far: this book gives a thorough treatment of oo concepts and how they can be implemented in java. it's a good intro to the language as well, and is example-based in its coverage of concepts. after becoming frustrated with various reference books, i decided to look carefully for a book that would teach solid principles of oop and also provide immediate experience in writing useful programs in java. this book distinguishes itself by going above and beyond those requirements. the introduction to the emerging area of design patterns was inspirational. however, the book omitted treatment of threads and networking in favor of ""miscellaneous"" topics like rmi and jdbc, and particular applications that illustrate the principles of design patterns like fast fourier transform and printing. not a complete reference, but as an introduction to some very important software design concepts it cannot be beat by other books that try to cover the entire language.",1,162
"clear and concise: as a psychotherapist, i am always interested in self-help books that might be valuable to myself and my clients. this book, along with scott wexzler's book, ""living with the passive-agressive man,"" are the two books i continually recommend to those people who feel angry and ""crazy"" in relationships and yet don't quite understand what is going on. this book is especially valuable because not only does the author define passive-aggressive behavior, he gives concrete ideas of how to constructively recognize and address it. also, he provides a realistic assessment of the effects p/a has on a relationship and the difficulty one will have in recognizing and disengaging from this anger. well written and easy to follow, this book is a valuable asset to anyone caught up in the tentacles of passive aggressive, or hidden, anger.",1,138
sodom lumber crane hard to maneuver: lumber crane doesn't seem to work very well. it's not easy loading the log into the crane especially for a three year old. my grandkids basically build tracks and run their motorized trains on the tracks. everything else is superfluous.,1,46
"good soup - korean kimchi - soup bowl -: i usually am not big on reviews but i ordered the soup because many people had commented favorably. i like noodles but the pre-prepared types (soups) are too salty and to chemically infused for my taste. today the package arrived and after trying this soup i have to say ""it is pretty good"". the packaging is very interesting and seems environmentally friendly. i might try something else from this company.",1,79
"review latest album lifehouse: i think the new lifehouse album is great. i'm from holland and here this album is not even for sale. i don't think this is the best album they made so far. but that is my personal opinion. i'm more into songs like simon, hanging by a moment and you and me. there are not many songs like that on the album. even though it's a great album",1,72
"the best lucky boys album yet: i feel that this is the best lucky boys confussion cd yet. it has a lot of great songs that get stuck in your mind. all of the songs sound great instrumentally and the songs are really easy to learn the words too (especially if you listen to them as much as i have). ""atari"" is probably my favorite song because it says so much about my life. ""driver"" is also a great song to listen to especially while you are driving. the songs on this album are so easy to get into, and the music is so easy to just start singing along with. the cd is just a really great one, i feel that it is the best one yet.",1,128

"great product, but don't feel any difference after a while.: received this from a doctor for food poisoning in samples. this nuked the food poisoning in just a few hours. worked well. a couple months later, i got food poisoning again. decided to invest in this for protection. got my system going again. once you are healed and use it as a vitamin, you won't really feel a difference as if you didn't take it. it's all on you to keep a good system going. all in all, this product works quite well.",1,93
"can't wait to use!: i received this item and i couldn't be happier with it. my husband and i are expecting our first little one in december and cannot wait to use this item. when it arrived, i opened it and immediatly wanted one for my self it is very soft and seems as thought it will provide much needed support for baby's head and body.",1,66

"the dogs: after eric serra's terible atempt to make bond music a reality in the 90's with his keboard beats and wierd noises, david anorld score for 'tnd' kicks arse in many places and makes serra think that he should have taken art!!!!arnolds full orchestral score hits all the good points and more form what you expect from a bond soundtrack. the first score track you hear on the cd intitled ' white knight ' is probably the best track kicking of with the gun barrel sequence which then leads into a very tense and atmospheric piece of music, while this progreses the tention finaly lets go with a super aray of brillient arnold/bond action music with snipets from the main title song, great!its just a pity that davids aronlds talent was not used to make goldeneye a succes, tnd on the other hand is a huge improvement.",1,148
"for potential students: this book is for any potential students who wish to explore careers in forensic science. i purschased this book out of plain curiosity, and this field of science is truly amazing to practically no end. forensic science is a fascinating career to discover, and if you are the type of student who needs constant stimulation then you should read this book.",1,64

"""all i need is my plastic jesus"": one of the few truly perfect movies ever made. great cast, incredible chemistry, amazing flow, newman in his prime, strother martin at his bizarre best. i might have put joy harmon in a thong but other than that i got no complaints. do they still make sling blades? 5 eggs",1,57

i loved the golden locket.: the golden locket was alot of fun to read. the character development was excellent. the dialog seemed so real. i loved the ending. the author has a wonderful imagination.,1,34
"great illustrations: the illustration of techniques in this book is magnificent. i really appreciate the close-up shots and clear photography. if i have a complaint about the book it's that the book is too focused on 'container' type projects. the methods illustrated can easily be adapted, though.",1,47
"every song is great: this is one of those albums that is over befor you know it, and leaves you wanting more. this is by far the circle jerks best album.",1,31
"bring your glasses.: with 5 hundred and thirty some pages of text, greene certainly has a lot to say. fortunately, most of it is very good - as others has said! not as much on the zero point field and applications as i had hoped but stayed relatively pretty free of new age conversations. my only reason for 4 stars is not content but the size of the print, especially the notes. use good light or glasses. thumbs up.",1,79
great read!: the upper room was a great read. i rate it 4stars because the ending was not the normal ending to a great book. mama ruby was a lady you wouldnt want to mess with.,1,36
"biber with affekt: i've found myself listening repeatedly to this disk. i'm already a convinced biber fan (i enjoy his quirkiness, which no doubt is what puts off some reviewers). this performance is not only lively it also allows you to fix on the fascinating sound world of scordatura strings (including the viola d'amore), giving a slightly other-wordly sonority from the opening sonata of partia i. the rfc understand very well that baroque music is all about rhetorical gestures (""affekten""). they have the benefit of a powerful church organ and a large choice of plucked and bowed continuo instruments (harp, theorbo, guitar, gamba, cello, ...) and they play with a virtuosity that's absolutely appropriate for this music. if you come across this disk, get a copy.",1,126
"i love it!: i absolutely love bear naked fruit and nut blend. i was reluctant to try it, but i am so glad i did. the oats and sesame seeds are nicely flavored and provide a nice little bite. the walnuts and almonds are big and pack a punch of flavor. i could care less for the raisins, but i am not a big fan of them in any setting.my favorite preparations are over some plain vanilla yogurt (especially if you add fresh berries), or simply as is for a light snack. i also like to add some other dried fruit to make it last longer.this is a great item for those with dietary restrictions. when i fast for lent or other orthodox fasts, i always grab a bag as a filling snack.i could not be happier. this product is simple, good, and versatile. highly recommended.",1,146

"dvd please: this is a truly remarkable film. i can add little to the earlier reviews except to note that the vhs version is different from the original.steiger and plummer are to my mind spot on. wellington was both dour and very charming - otherwise he would not have been so effective as a ladies' man!i remember going to the original widescreen version at the odeon in leicester square - a truly widescreen. my recollection of the movie is that it was significantly longer, with additional vignettes featuring at least two of the ""scum of the earth"". moreover, i have a distinct feeling that the cavalry charge against the squares is far longer in the orginal version. my hope is that the dvd version when it comes will fully restore this movie...",1,132
first day at nursery school: lauren writes:my first day at nursery school by becky edwards is about a little girl who does not want to go to nursery school because she is scared. instead she wants to stay with her mommy at home. she has never been to a school. she has never met anyone or played with other children without her family knowing the other family. her first day is the most important day for her and she does not want to be embarrassed. i recommend this book for kids who are 2-4 years old. 2-4 is appropriate age group because most likely anyone older than 4 has gone through their first day of school. i was about 3 when my mom first read this book to me. i was nervous for my first day of school just like the little girl. i give my first day at nursery school by becky edwards a 4 out of 5 rating. will the girl like nursery school? or will she want to go home? read my first day at nursery school to find out.,1,183

"good quality, wrong size: i purchased these fittings with the idea of converting the a/c system from an r-12 freon charge, to the r-134a freon type. these fittings arrived and were a great quality, but due to operator error (all mine), i ordered the wrong fitting for the connection on my type of vehicle. fortunately amazon and the supplier were quite nice in taking back the parts for a full refund.",1,71

"great work of reconstructing a past, day-by-day.: it describes incredibly detailed the birth and the growing up of this great band, a few years almost day-by-day (not to mention the very nice pitures).",1,33
interesting: this book reads as if it's true. it's very interesting and set in the mekong delta area. seal teams did multiple missions iin that area during that timeframe. the book is very much like another seal's book sold by amazon. i bought both which is not necessary. if you buy one i don't think you need the other. many of the missions are too similar. good book.,1,68
"well worth your time.: this was a fun, enjoyable read. i would like to read some follow up books on the characters, and i think there are at least two more but they are very pricey, out of my league.tim is a gifted writer, with characters and shorelines you really care about. thanks, for the good time.",1,57
"another excellent album from a band who keeps getting better: ""this desert life"", the newest album from the counting crows, seems to bring together everything that fans love about the band, adam's dense, and incredibly meaningful lyrics, a multitude of instruments, and some wonderful harmony all have a chance to showcase themselves. old themes, like 'anna' and 'maria' surface again, and are joined by 'amy'. my overarching impression of this album as compared to the others is much happier. 'august and everything after' seemed to swirl around losing yourself by making yourself a household name. 'recovering the satellites' was very dark. 'this desert life' is more upbeat, and had (to my ears at least) hints of csny (see 'four days')and the black crows (see 'kid things', the bonus track). i am hoping that the band will keep experimenting with musical styles (they cover a lot of ground here), and instrumentation in the future. all in all, a wonderful album for cc fans out there.",1,164
"hard to find - no longer in production: i replaced a bilge pump that i've had for years - same type. the auto feature is fail-safe, better than float or water actuated types. works good, lasts long time.",1,38

nutty novelty: this cd is excellent. ape call by nervous norvus is funny. so is delicious by jim backus.and kookie kookie lend me your comb by edd byrnes and connie stevens.not to mention baby sittin boogie by buzz clifford. and the flying saucer by buchanan and goodman even though they only had part one. there was also witch doctor by david seville and the purple people eater by sheb wooley.and of course theyre coming to take me away ha ha by napoleon xiv. i could go on. as i said this is an excellent cd.,1,95

"best when there is no socket: i have to pump in the bathroom twice a day in the office, as all the conference rooms are with glass walls and doors. since the bathroom has no socket for me to plug in, i am really glad that this pump can be used with 2 aa batteries. i have been using it for 3 months already, and thankfully, my baby is still exclusively breastfed.though i find the pump is really noisy with the loud humming sound (so i guess my co-workers using the next cubicle will know what i am doing), and does not work as well by using batteries: with slightly weaker suction, and the power runs out really quickly, that's the best electric pump in the market that i can find. i would recommend it to my friends who want to express in the office with no private office room. or if you plan to travel without the baby.",1,159

"wow: that is some pretty interesting/amazing stuff. a lot of the knowledge and concepts in this book already resonates with my own experiences; but a lot of this stuff is new as well. the possibilites expressed are uplifting... if you have the time, i definitely recommend it as a good read.",1,51
"great laptop case!: this laptop case is great for those who have larger 17.3'' laptops. i have an asus g73jh and i've been having a tough time finding a case that will hold my laptop and not look so bulky as well as save a few bucks. this case can hold my laptop and power brick just fine and still looks very thin. the constructions is sturdy and the padding is sufficient. combine that with a great price of only $35 on here with free shipping, if you have a prime account it's only 3.99 for overnight. can't beat that. cost locally at a bestbuy is about $54.",1,108
"good plot: i had to come back and edit this review. previously (years ago) i had given the movie a bad review because amazon had ripped me off and i couldn't download the movie. since then, amazon has fixed their glitches, and i have finally been able to see the movie. it was well acted, and i like how they went back to the art over film style (as was done with a movie back in the 80's....i think it was lord of the rings, or the hobbit, or something like that). the cast worked well for the movie, and the plot, while slow, kept me watching. i apologize for the bad review that i left before because of amazon's flaw.",1,121

"good but...: the album is very good. lots of varying styles and good honest acoustic guitar playing. but, with howe and martin on the same album, it should have been better. there's nothing really special to make the album reach new heights. if you're a fan of either guitarist, then i'd say it's money well spent.",1,56
"this is a great book with beautiful pictures.: i believe that this book was very well written. after reading the book i think it tells you so much about her. this book is filled with beautiful pictures the 2 best looking to me were on pages 14 and 84. this book tells about her,how hard she worked and about the sacrifices she had to make in her own life. all in all it's a must read for you people that have not yet done so.",1,85

"enjoyable mysteries: if your a fan of the black and white mysteries of the 30's and 40's, like charlie chan and sherlock holmes, you will want to add the mr. moto series to your collection. i just watched them for the first time, and enjoyed all of them.",1,48
"the natvity story: over 20 of us spanning three generations went and saw this moving and most of us have since bought the dvd. we are in an audio and visual world,and this movie helps us to see, hear and feel in a new way the story we have grown up with. katie, a 12 year old confirmation student, summed it up. i have grown up with the story and been in the christmas play from the baby to mary. this made it so real to me that i could take it in.",1,93
"good unscented product: i've used this product for a while now. it works okay for cleaning, and none of us break out from it or choke on a fragrance.if you sign up for the automatic shipping (super savers, i think it's called) program, you get free shipping and a discount, so the price works out to around $4.75 per bottle. in the area where i live, that's only a few cents higher than i would pay at the store, and i get the added bonus of never running out. we live out in the country, and the local stores don't carry this often, so it's worth the extra few cents to me to keep my unscented detergent on hand. now if amazon would only carry the unscented downy, which they currently don't...",1,132
"convenient, compact, lightweight -- in my purse all the time: this is a really fantastic product. it is so small, sleek, and lightweight that it is easy to have it with me at all times. i find it invaluable for determining the size (and therefore the caloric consequences) of restaurant foods. cannot recommend it highly enough. go forth and weigh.",1,60
"a wonderful book for good and bad little girls and boys.: as i read through this funny, sweet book, i couldn't resist reading the clever rhymes out loud. i'd laughed so hard by the time i was done, i had to take a nap. murray touched my heart and i'll never forget him. i just wish this book had been written when i was a child. the illustrations are just as delightful and funny as the story. i think children will ask their parents to read this book to them over and over again -- and parents won't tire of reading it.",1,102
"christmas classic!: this is a must see every christmas season. contains the movie and the option of commentary from some of the cast members that you can listen to as you watch the movie. otherwise, there are no other extras on the dvd menu, which i wasn't planning on anyway.",1,50

"must read: 1984 has come and left, some may say that this book has lost its importance after the collapse of communism. i think that if we want to keep our freedom than we need to pay attention to the politicians we elect and the agencies that they are suppose to regulate. the important point about 1984 is that if you don't pay attention 1984 can always become a reality. need to listen to some of the people running for the top spot in this country and you can see them building their own ministry of truth.r hemingwaypast twilight",1,99
"a wonderful collaboration for the soul...: this cd with its wide variety of muscians, ranging from tibet, to douglas p. have put together a most memorable experience for the wandering ear. you are eloquently broadcasted into a sea of blissful insomnia while listening to this cd. i would recommend it to any and all....",1,54
"set of 50 clear bowl covers: love these - much handier & tidier than using tear off plastic wraps to cover bowls - plus, they offer a more secure fit. i even use the smaller ones to wrap & protect the cut, unused ends of onions, lemons, tomatoes, cantaloupes, etc. after a vigorous search of my local grocery stores & big box stores, who used to offer similar covers, came up empty handed, i was disappointed to be informed by a store manager that they no longer carried the covers because the manufacturer stopped making them. i am so glad i found a place where i am once again able to buy round, plastic bowl covers. i also like the fact that they can be washed & reused which is an added value.",1,133
"an extraordinary guide and historical source book: steve porcella and cameron burns spent at least two summers collecting information from historical figures while putting up newroutes to all fifteen of the >14k foot peaks in california. this book is chockfull of history gathered directly from some of the earlyclimbers of these sierra peaks. many of the approaches to these peaks are arrived at by hiking (which is half the fun when in thesierras). as both authors are world class climbers and besides supplying detailed maps and routes traced onto photos of the peaks,they have included many b&w photos of such points of interest as approach scenery, actual routes, historical contributors, as wellas many photos of themselves climbing the routes. thoroughly enjoyable, this book is as interesting for the armchair climber asfor individuals wishing to expand their climbing horizons by exploring these magnificent mountains in california.",1,145

chuckit works: lets me throw the ball a lot further than i can with my arm. got the small one which fits in my pocket. keeps my hands clean.,1,29
engaging: since people should save 5 stars for enduring classics. i chose four stars. rarely does a novel hit such a range of emotions in a reader (at least in my case) as did egolf's book. i found myself hating and rooting for major and insignificant characters alike from beginning to end. tradgedy of biblical proportions became uncommonly comic throughout the novel. to which made a highly enjoyable suprise. i chanced upon lotb in a new writer's section at a local bookstore. what i consider a find should be read by all who find themselves lucky enough to find themselves readers.,1,101

"bishop, you have never written with such abandon and urgency: bishop, you are so right about the original christian spirit and the state of christianity today. your books always leave me breathless and open to god in new and renewed spiritual ways. they say everything that needs to be said and brought out into the open. your writing here shows that you are determined to do all that you can to keep christ in our hearts in a realistic way for the twenty-first century. i have never seen you write with such abandon and urgency. what can i do to help?",1,101

"a chore...but worth it in the end.: this was my first experience with faulkner and i was overwhelmed. as i forced myself to get past the first few chapters, i loathed the language, the names of the characters, the interrupted style. to faulkner's credit, however, i could see the vultures, smell the smells, and commiserate with the [unbelievable] lot of characters. i found myself getting completely unnerved just wishing they would hurry up and bury her! the ending was a great surprise and earned the story a few extra stars in my opinion. reflecting back on the painful task of getting through it, i realized that this book actually made me think! his style is unlike anything i've ever encountered and i'm a better person for having read it. tough? definitely. worth reading? i think so.",1,136
"wonderfully scary and entertaining! needs a sequel!: i love adventure puzzle games and this did not disappoint! it really is more scary than you would think and all without a lot of the gore that frankly sickens me that you see in many computer games and movies. reminiscent of the older scary ghost story movies that can create a chill up your spine and many looks over your shoulder. really engrossing and like many of the other reviewers i found it a lot shorter than i'd like. please game creators, give us a sequel and make it much longer! i, for one, would be willing to pay the extra money!",1,110
"one of my favorite: this book was one of the favorite i have ever read. huxley disguises the meaning of the book at the beginning, but if you give it a chance, you will love it. the story of the future in which everything has been sacrificed, brave new world is about a man who knows about earth's past, but the people created by bottles are ignorant of the world. the people are made to repeat a cycle over and over without knowing any reason for life. in savage reservations, where people live in the past, like we do today, one",1,101
"good but way too much hype: when i heard everyone raving about the madonna drowned world tour i had to check it out for myself. i've seen her blonde ambition and girlie show tours (on video) before so i was ready for this one. i have to say that much of it is hype. it was a good concert but it was sort of dull at times. the costume changes were'nt as great and there wasn't a lot of dancing. madonna played the guitar here and there... that was new. the bull ride that she did in ""don't tell me/human nature"" was way too short. it wasn't even worth mentioning. some people described the geisha themed segment as ""awesome"" and ""magical"" but i found it to be ok at best. she flew across the stage.. big deal. she did an air spin like a scene out of crouching tiger, hidden dragon... cool. i thought it looked cool but it didn't live up to the hype. and what the heck was up with that anime video thing? it was weird. so, i was a bit disappointed at times. madonna drowned world tour ends with her hit ""music.""",1,196

"not microserfs: dennis coupland's miss wyoming was not at all what i expected, but it was well worth the wild read. part social commentary on the cult of celebrity and part gonzo hollywood buddy book, this is a fun story that has some very poignant moments. from the aging movie producer in recovery to the crazy mom of the former child beauty queen, the characters are well-drawn.the locations lack detail and panache, but the real story here is the people. this book leaves you wanting just a little bit more.",1,90

"the real deal: modern county music has lost its sense of melody along with its sense of traditional themes (try singing along with big & rich & some of the every current stars). this is one of the reasons that joni harms is special - her songs actually have a melody & deal with the themes usually associated with country music. the other reasons are that they are sung by a lady who has a great voice & alot of enthusiasm, & the songs are just good music - they are not over-produced & the musicians are playing traditional country music instruments; no synthesizers or wailing elctric guitars. this cd is great & so is the more recent ""let's put the western back in coutry music"".you should buy these cd's because you will enjoy them and also to send a message to the ""suits"" in nashville that we want our country music back.",1,153
"possibly the best metallica album: i own all of the metallica albums, and ajfa is my favorite one. all of the songs are good i can listen to the whole thing withour touching the skip button. it also has a variety of songs; you have ""blackened,"" and ""dyers eve,"" which are extremely fast songs then you have ""one"" which starts off slow and gets fast, and all the others are good too. the insturmental ""to live is to die"" is amazing, from the guitar work to the drumming i think it is metallicas best instrumental. it is not a cd you get tired of after listening it a few times either. go out and buy this cd, you wont be sorry.",1,121

"great solution if you have an xbox 360: setting up this remote was a painless user experience. i plugged it in, let the logitech software download the latest firmware, input the list of brands and models of the equipment i have, the software suggested a list of activities, and less than five minutes later everything just worked.i did the configuration on a macintosh - a lot of times vendors deliver poorly written software for the mac, but the logitech software for this remote didn't suck. they also included the usb cable needed to program it, and since the packaging allows you to press a button and see a demo, they included a second set of batteries to ensure you didn't end up with a dead set.i picked this because i wanted to be able to control my xbox 360, but it also works with my apple tv.apple ma711ll/a tv with 40gb hard drivexbox 360 console includes 20gb hard drive",1,159

"highly recommended for those interested in the future: i attended a lecture the author gave summarizing his book. if you're interested in globalization, the environment, or any other global problems, i highly recommend reading this book. it was deliberately limited in length, so it is a really quick read... about 5 pages for each of 20 problems and an additional 100 pages or so presenting the general problems and his proposed solution.",1,72

"not the best movie ever, but one of the funniest!: this movie generates lots of laughs when a ""happy drug"" traps people in their best memory forever. the plot's a little choppy, and a bit slow in parts, and it's certainly not for the easily offended, but the whole movie's worth repeated viewing when scott thompson's character comes out of the closet in a prolonged musical number. or when bruce mcculloch's depressed rock star turns into an osmond-wannabe. yes, brendan fraser's in a cameo appearance, but the kids are the real stars. definitely worth owning.",1,95
trims well: this product works very well. the 3 cutting guides allow you to pick the correct length. there is an adjustable cutting guide that was of no use. the charger has to be plugged into the trimmer instead of just putting the trimmer into a charging cradle. this is inconvenient.,1,51

gospel in the stars: the information provided in this book is excellent and insightful. its presentation though makes it a little difficult to follow. i note that the original publication date was 1882 and maybe this is why it's not as easy as a more modern day version would be. i keep putting it down but have to keep picking it up again.,1,63

"this dvd rocks!: for all of you out there that is a big olp fan, this completes your set! it's like being there at the concert. one thing i love about this dvd is that the video is so clear and you can hear the music perfectly. they have good interviews and all different songs, more than what they had on their live cd. and having to watch beautiful raine maida sing in the privacy of your own house makes it even better. :) i recommend this dvd to anyone who loves olp and would like to actually watch them sing then to hear it!!",1,105

"""batman"" shows how a comic superhero film should be done.: even if ""superman"" is a decent movie, batman is the real thing; tim burton created an ultra-stylized film, and his dark version of the superhero paid tribute to the true spirit of the comics, instead of using the style of the tv comedy series; in my opinion that was the right choice.this film is also the best of the series; when tim burton and michael keaton left this movie franchise after ""batman returns"", the quality of the rest of the films was pretty poor. in ""batman"" there are a lot of things to enjoy: good performances (michael keaton, jack nicholson of course, kim basinger and jack palance, to name a few), good music, great sets, ultra cool gadgets (the batmovile is amazing) and a very interesting story.a comic superhero film is not an easy to make, but tim burton proved to be the right choice in this film.",1,158
finally: the only way to have this release until now was on vinyl. the cd release before this had been tampered with to give it more of a modern/dance tone - and was not the real thing at all. this release finally remasters from the original tapes and it sounds great. good bonus live tracks too.,1,56

"definitely different w/o dave: as a long time fan of sum 41 who fell in love with the band at the 2003 warped tour, i have to say that former lead guitarist, dave ""brownsound"" baksh, was right in saying that the band got darker and had lost their sense of humor. the title track is definitely misleading, making you think that this sum 41 going back to the beginning. i also agree with the other reviewers in saying that this cd makes the band sound too similar to green day. however, that doesn't stop me from enjoying this album, although forever lost are the hints of metallica and megadeth. the songs still retain their classic sum 41 catchiness and the great presentation of awesome lyrics (on most of the songs, anyway).",1,131
tear jerker: my daughter's kindergarten teacher read this to the kids and the parents the first day of school for orientation. i can tell you not a dry eye with the bunch of us parents! it was so touching that evening as well when my daughter asked me to kiss her hand so she could take it to school with her the first day. this will be an heirloom book for my other child as well as my grandchildren,1,79
"oh my gosh: phenominal game. like the other guy, i am about 21 percent through the game but i found the chase exhilerating, like no other in any game. the blurryness is from your panic and if you do well, you won't be very blurry but if you keep looking at the guys breaking down doors that you lock behind you, or get shot a couple times, it goes downhill fast, but that is what makes it so intense. i wish they made more games like this where you actually do things and flesh out the story before going in guns blazing (like half life 1). overall one of a kind game and actually pretty scary and intene. i don't even find games like resident evil or silent hill 2 to be scary or intense like this. hell of a game with great graphics on my 360 and great surround sound with an enthralling storyline and detailed world. very good for a mature gamer who has other games like devil may cry and halo to satisfy my bloodlust.",1,178
"hours of fun!: we absolutely love this cube! i bought it for my 5m nephew...and although he can't quite sit up on his own yet, it is still an entertainer for him. anytime we want to distract him, we start up the magic cube! the sounds are good (not annoying) and becos you can add and subtract any ""instrument"", it is not boring. i do wish the lights were brighter and more visual, but this is becod the cube itself is so colorful. great product!",1,85
"cassie has a fresh soulful sound and a great future ahead: this will be the greatest soundtrack of all times it has so much grit blend with smooth sounds of the old rythm and blues while still giving the jazz classics. it's time that a soundtrack actually complented the motion picture. i was really surprised that the song ""girl"" did not get more air time or commericial support, it seemed to encompass the entire movie. top preformances from every one on this effort.",1,83
wonderful!: an up close look into the life of brain injury survivors. i have a tbi from a car accident and my life has changed dramatically. people who do not live with the condition just do not get it. i look the same as i did prior to the accident and yet my brain does not work the way that it did before the accident. everything is difficult now. this is an excellent documentary into the life of tbi survivors.....,1,80

"much better than expected!!: i absolutely love this stuff. i had been eye-ing a few different water sprays, but i never understood why anyone would spend money on what seemed like just water in a can. now i get it! i am very fair skinned and extremely sensitive to temperature changes, so when the air gets dry in the winter but the heat is blasting, my skin isn't happy. when i'm overheated, my face is very red and blotchy. my skin is also extremely sensitive to chemicals, so i have to be careful about what products i use on it. i keep this spray can in my fridge and after a workout or a hot shower, i spray this mist on and it feels amazing. you can see it dew up on your skin for a few moments and it calms down my skin by about 50% immediately. it also is great for spritzing right before you moisturize -- it locks in moisture really well. i will never be without this product. highly recommend for anyone who gets red in the face and needs a natural, refreshing way to cool down!",1,191
thank you: the book arrived just on time. it was my pleasure to purchase book from your company. the book itself is very interesting too.,1,25

works but watch where you put it: careful to put the adaptor at a high place like on top of your desk hutch. do the same for the wireless access point. it makes a much better signal.,1,37
"pretty good: this is pretty good keyboard, for the price, especially becuase it has two usb ports. i have an ibook, which only comes with two usb ports of its own, so having the extra two is very nice. it was pretty easy to set up too, just plug it in and your mac pretty much does the rest. the only problem i have with this is the depth of the keys. if you are used to typing on a laptop that has shallow key depths, it takes a little time to get used to this keyboard. it doesn't seem like that big of a deal, but it does slow down my typing. but then again, i probably would have had the same problem with any other keyboards.",1,128

"great animation movie - poetic sci-fi: the original manga from masamune shiro was somewhat a great experience. but instead of just trying to render the manga to the screen, mamoru oshi (patlabor 1&2, jinro...) created a real piece of art! both the design, story, rythm, animation, drawing and music are absolutly astounding! this is not just a sci-fi movie. it avoids all the ""clichés"" and is more poetic than violent. if i had to keep only one movie, this will be the one.",1,83

"excellent book !!!: i just finished reading this book. i must say, that as a pc tech , this book is one of the best i've come across. carey has made it easy for the casual user to understand how to take care of their own computer and fix simple problems. it's written in simple to understand language that anyone can follow. this book is also a valuable reference for even experienced technicians.i will be recommending this book as a must have for all of my customers. thanks to carey for bringing a book like this to the masses.",1,99
"washington trivia: this is a fun and interesting book! i purchased it for my son after he recently moved to washington state from our home state of ny. i thought it would make for an interesting way to learn about his new home state. really offers many informative facts that i didn't see in any of the other books i purchased about the state at the same time.explains many of the words, terms and folklore of the state which makes for a fun read!",1,84
"compact clock w/ easy-on-eyes illumination: i bought two of these to place in the cabinets i made to house the cable boxes and dvd players. the size of the clock is good for a bed stand, kitchen, den, pretty much anywhere one needs an easy-to-read clock; and the intensity is medium bright (subjective, i know--the display's numbers never appear to 'bloom') and easily readable from across a large room. the display is quite comfortable on one's eyes, unlike some bright-red displays on similar digital clocks. i purchased these on sale through amazon for under $5 each. if you order one, you'll need to buy a standard rectangular 9v battery in order to support the clock's battery-backup feature. this clock works as it should, it disappears in a room sans the display, and it has battery backup--it's a good value.",1,139
"pump is certainly good for the price: i don't know if i would call this a ""large fountain pump"". i bought it for our fountain which is a medium fountain with a 4 foot lift height. the pump arrived and it looked kind of small, i was skeptical. it does work, and certainly for $23 it's worth it. even if it only lasts a couple of years its worth it. i had a much larger pump, that this sunterra pump replaced, which moved more water than this little one and it failed after 2.5 years (warranty 1 year). it was three times the price. the flow is a little weak for a 4 foot lift height, but it is adequate, and if it keeps working the way it does now, i would be happy with it.",1,136

"one of their best: if you haven't heard gbv, well, you shouldn't start by listening to their ablums. you should go see them live. they tour all the time, so get off your butt and go be amazed. once you've done that, bee thousand is a good placed to start as far as recorded material (though i'd personally choose alien lanes.) you'll be amazed what a few losers from ohio can do with a 4-track and a fair amount of beer.",1,81

"a clever, funny and unique ""how-to"" guide: this book is not like other ""how to"" guides that put you to sleep rather than provide you with any useful information. the book is cleverly written and so funny you don't want to put it down. the information provided in the book is up-to-date and the inserts from the ""go-to-girls"" feel like gossip (only useful gossip) you'd read in the style section of the new york times.although the book seems geared to 20 somethings, the info provided will make 30 and 40 somethings feel like they're in the know!",1,97

"the height of the chicago brass!: the chicago symphony has always had a great brass section, but this is the proof. who cares if it's not musical? when the trombone section completely obliterates the rest of the orchestra during the 1812it is just glorious! and in marche slave when the low brass gets theczarist national anthem, charlievernon takes the bass trombonepart down the octave and blasts overthe tuba deep in the pedal range!like i said, it may not be completelymusical, but it's a testament to what can be done.",1,89
"works perfectly: after reading the pair of ""doesn't work"" reviews from the same person, i decided to try it anyway, figuring that amazon would do an easy refund if it really didn't work (also, i've had good experiences with other sonnet products in the past).it works just fine for me. i've used it to connect an ipod and an isight to the firewire800 port on my powerbook, both work fine. it seems a decent value and i'm happy with it.",1,80
"thoroughly engrossing! historical fiction fans must read.: for me, noah gordon has created a ""time machine"" in the physician. in its pages i am transported to northern europe's darkest hours. i can almost feel the misty mornings and smell the muddy roads along which a ""touched"" boy trods, searching for his place in a threatening world. we are offered a well developed and supported transformation from the young man's early survival years to his life-making, heart-wrenching commitment to the art of healing. along the way, we witness many fascinating points relating the beliefs and practices of judaism. the historical points are well-researched and well-placed.the pace of the physician slowed just long enough for me to take a deep breath - now and then - and jump back in! the ending made sense and felt good to me. so much so that i located and purchased mr. gordon's other books! if they are near to the physician's satisfying read, i'll be very happy indeed!",1,163
"the best thing since james hall chapt 3!: what can i say. james hall & wap have surpassed the unsurpassable. this album is as outstanding as it is eclectic, using so many styles to glorify god. there's gotta be something in there for everyone. james isn't known all that well over here (i'm doing all i can to rectify that!), and those who do know, adore everything he does, but if you haven't heard, you are seriously missing some blessings. my favourite songs are jesus lives, hold to god's unchanging hand, i've got to praise him.i've got all the jh&wap albums and i eagerly anticipate 'messiah' (due out 1 jan 2000 for those of you who didn't know). i dare not imagine james' interpretation of handel's classic.....if i could choose one artist to go and see perform, it would be jh&wap- so c'mon please, please, please get over here, we're waiting......",1,151

"a great addition to your studying material: i've purchased this book elsewhere. but this is not the point. i will compare it to giles. much better, both construction of the studying material and exam question-answer part. unlike giles, npte has thorough explained question and answer choices, and an option of pausing the test. npte has three exams. giles though has four exams and visually it is constructed very closely to a real one, little if any question explanation. bottom part you'll benefit from both. but if you're short of green go with npte. don't know the difference between npte 2008 and 2009 editions though. i'd be thankful if you'll provide that info.thank you,polegini just had a look at 2009 edition. all that's been added is a color print, that is it. test questions are the same.",1,136

"great intro, a little repetitive: this is a great intro to tibetan buddhism, although towards the end it gets too repetitive. you can probably just read the first half and get everything you need to know. also, it is really written from the perspective of the more traditional buddhist teachings, i.e. hinayana or theraveda, as opposed to the mystical tibetan teachings that form the basis for tantra or mahayana forms. so if you are just starting out on your study of tibetan buddhism, by all means read this book, but don't stop there.",1,93
"fusion frenzy review: this game is extremely fun to play, especially with friends. the variety of mini games is quite vast, and the replay value of this game is terrific. all of my friends loved playing it. the graphics aren't superb, but its focus is on gameplay, which makes up for the graphics.",1,53
"these guys are not teenyboppers!: for anyone who thinks hanson was just a short phase, listen to some of their music. could the backstreet boys have written something like ""yearbook"" or ""with you in your dreams?"" i don't think so! these guys are great songwriters, singers, and musicians, and i like how they do so many different kinds of music. some songs, like ""mmmbop make you want to get up and move, while others, like ""i will come to you"" are slower, with strong melodies.i sure am glad that i have this tape, and i can't wait to hear some new songs from zac, taylor, and isaac.",1,107
"a lot of good tunes here ! ! ! ! ! ! !: this is a good album wich includes a dvd, very nice songs and the videos too, the title say it all, from sinaloa to zacatecas this is a good star to get a collection, you will get a good idea of what banda is, if you are a video dj this also would suit you well, the price is good and the artist are worht it so don't think it twice and get it.",1,87
"a hobo, a hooker and hoodlums: i had been wanting to watch this since it came out and i finally got the chance, and i wasn't disappointed.the hobo is just looking for a nice place to live and maybe start his own business. he hops of the train in the most crime ridden city around. he soon finds himself in trouble and befriends a prostitute that he wants to help have a better life. they soon find themselves trapped in a war with street thugs, dirty cops and every other lowlife possible. the hobo decides it time to clean up the streets ""one shell at a time"".this does have a grindhouse feel but it reminds me more of a troma movie. the crime filled city, over the top violence, crazy thugs and colorful scenery look like a page out of the toxic avenger and that's ok. it works great for this movie. if you are a fan of trashy cinema, then you owe it to yourself to check this one out.",1,171
"awesome book: i really cannot say enough about this book and how illuminating it is to all of the facets of who jesus is. we have been using it in a bible study and i'm giving it to everyone i know. it's a quick, easy read, but packed with insight to really give you a lot to think about and meditate on. i definitely recommend it for anyone who is seeking to know jesus better.",1,75

not as good...: i bought this cd when it just came out last year (so i ain't got the bonus tracks) and happened to listen again to it recently so thought of posting a review. this cd is not as good as their previous 'all rise' partly because of the high expectations that fans and listeners alike have put on their second cd. the first few tracks on this cd is neither greater nor stronger compared to the songs on 'all rise' (they're about the same) but it gets too weak and unbearable to listen after 'don't treat me like a fool'. i liked 'all rise' too much to be able to listen to this too much.

"a short review: this is the third in the series of books on western geology, following 'basin and range' and 'in suspect terrain'. john mcphee has the ability to write very readable and knowledgable essays about almost any subject that he chooses to examine, and these three books are very much a case in point.whether you are seriously or just mildly interested in geology, this book is entertaining and infromative. there is enough family history (of his geologist companion), geological history etc. to keep you fascinated and to make for a good reading experience.",1,94
"laptop sleeve: this is the perfect laptop sleeve for the lenovo thinkpad x61. it comes with cloth handles that can be folded in if not desired and the zippers (two, one from each end closing at the center) are solid with two thumb-handles. when going through security at an airport, it's easy to remove from your luggage and then when through, close the zippers and place it back in your luggage. however, the fit for the x61 is snug (as i wanted it to be) and therefore, do not count on placing any additional large-sized hardware (such as a power adapter, although a small mouse will fit) into the sleeve. all in all, a very well made sleeve (surprisingly from microsoft) for the particular laptop, at a good price.",1,129
"well..it's alice in chains for cryin' out loud: there is little doubt that alice in chains was, and now is again one of the greatest rock bands of all time. the music has multitudinous positive aspects. a lot of the songs are available elsewhere but if you want a good look at the finest music that ever made the recording studio, look here. the music will grab you and shake your soul. jerry cantrell is one of the most incredible musicians to approach hard rock and his stuff is way beyond simple boom cha boom cha.. it freakin' rocks! i've got everything they ever released, and some things they didn't. hard rock and yet beautiful, soulful, alive and breathing fire, stunning! i still give this a regular listen. it's big stuff! i'm listenin to it right now. damn.. i'm gonna start weeping...",1,142

"a good start: this is a very readable book, explaining the need and ""how to"" of exercise and detailing a safe way to accomplish it. the exercises are explained in detail with pictures, but i find it hard to try to do them while having to look at the book frequently to make sure i am doing them correctly. i do better at watching the dvd i ordered, to learn the moves, and then duplicating them. teresa tapp is a very motivating personality and i would recommend people try out her plan, and reading the book first, is a great place to start before buying the dvds. it gives a good overview of the process and the ""whys"" and the basic ""hows."" i found it very interesting.",1,127

"possibly the best sing-a-long soundtrack ever!: almost thirty years since the music of the film first saw the light of day, the soundtrack from ""the rocky horror picture show"" is quite possibly the best sing-along soundtrack album ever. i mean, is there anyone in the world who hasn't heard such timeless classics as ""time warp"" or ""sweet transvestite""?this isn't an album that'll appeal to everyone - some of the tracks are pretty naff, but that's part of the fun of ""rocky horror.."". the only regret about this cd is it doesn't include the lovely ballad ""once in a while"" (which was, incidentally, cut from the film). in my opinion, that was one of the best songs. never mind, you still have a great album here, but you really need to see the movie to fully enjoy it.jon.",1,137
"i can't wait to get back in the kitchen!: get this book for health reasons, or just because you enjoy great tasting food. i've tried many different ways to improve my eating habits over the years, but none of them ever really seemed to make complete sense to me. i just knew there had to be a better/smarter path. it's true, this way of cooking will require more planning on your part, but it was still a lot of fun. actually, it was more fun cooking this way than other methods i'm used to. i imagine as i become more familiar with this way of cooking it will become much easier. while i've only made a few of the recipes so far, i have to say they were the best tasting meals i have ever prepared. for the very first time in my nearly 49 years, i felt a real connection and complete satisfaction with the food i prepared and consumed. the food will sing to you, i promise! i can't wait to get back in the kitchen!",1,178

"what you expect from sony!: i have had this system for 2 weeks. there are pros and cons and much to my surpize sony has already corrected what this system lacks. the sound is excellent! the best sound i have heard from any surround sound system. you can hear every sound on the disc....its better then my bose and cost less. the cons...it lacks the picture quality that other sony dvd players have. the pixel rate is 480 not 1080i..even with the progressive scan on it losses some of the quality of the picture. you can only load one disc at a time and last most dvd players will start the disc where you last cut it off, not this one. you have to reset the disc features for sound. all in all i am pleased that i finally went with the dream!",1,143
"seems to be best whey out there!: i have used lots of different protein products (among other things) and this one seems to work well. i previously used muscle milk protein plus, but after costco stopped carrying it i couldn't find it any more. since my wife uses it too i had to get something with ok taste, low calories and high quality protein and this one does the trick. i am not a big fan of the sweetener (natural, stevia i believe) so i ended up blending in a scoop of the muscle milk pure whey for flavor. my wife doesn't mind the stevia so she is good with this product by itself.",1,114
great movie: i enjoyed every aspect of this film. i have it on my kindle where i can watch it any time i want.,1,24
"not bad: first off to the idiot who said his gun didnt work because he charged it all night. these guns come with a very cheap battery, if you charge it for more than the allotted time (2 hours 35 minutes) you will destroy the battery.anyway the gun.this is an excelent gun for the cost, it out ranges any of the cyma guns and simply dominates in a spring war (i would know i whipped this baby out in the middle of a pistol match and got 7 people) its magazine is kinda difficult to load and spills bbs out if you remove it before it is empty. also dont put the magazine in without the barrel in propperly or the mag empties into the gun. this thing has high fps around 220 -240 (yes i cronographed it) the only problem is mine doesnt really work on single because it double feeds apart from that this gun rocks.",1,158
"moffatts:not that bad: the moffatts are a new (hanson-like) group.yet it doesn't even fathom me to compare them. the moffatts seem to me to have more talent! they write there own music , unlike hanson. to add to the pleasure of listening them they are all adorable (especially dave, sorry i had to say something about him).they also have more class. there songs are ballads that are heartfelt and could make any girl cry. my favorite titles ""love"", it made me think of the best romance in the world,my boyfriend and me. now if a song can make you hear and/or see things beyond the music that group has talent!",1,110
"great product!: at first glance, the sound machine looks very outdated and old, but it really does a great job of masking noise. our son had gotten used to sleeping with a humidifier, but i was tired of filling it, so thought i'd try this instead and it is awesome! they could work on updating the look, though!",1,58
must see!: very good and intense from beginning to end.michael chiklis is very convincing in the role of vic mackey.,1,20
happy with the games: having these games on my ipaq makes the drive to school much more fun for my 11 year-old son.,1,23
"smokey has ""it"" and always will: of the more than hundred dvd's i have, this is by far the best. smokey sounds just as good as he did back in the 70's. i love this man and his music. i hope he will continue doing concerts forever so that those of us who love him can look at the dvd's when we're coming home from one of those concerts. he's a wonderful entertainer and i can't get enough of him. oh, the dvd; yes! he sings ""ooh baby baby"" like he never sang it before. fans, this one's a must-have and a keeper and one you will enjoy over and over.",1,111
"i grew up on woodstock.: i grew up on woodstock, you will never hear this type of live concert ever again.woodstock is what the music was all about, 350.000 music lovers enjoying three days of great acts and geting to know one another.this cd. is the best to ever come around. if you love this music, you will love woodstock.",1,60
"well made: finding a hose coupling this size was not easy. it is well made and grips tight to the hose. made of some top quality plastic that takes a pretty good beating. not exactly rocket science, but when you need a hose coupling in this size, this is a decent product.",1,52
"wonderful end of the book: what an incredible series this was. i still wouldn't call it perfect, but it is up there among the best 3 or 4 fantasy series of all time. frankly, at least for now it would be 2 or 3 on my list. no, it's not perfect, but it was outstanding, and kept me going throughout. i finished the entire series in a week, and now can't wait to start the next set - though i may have to put it off for a brief bit while i attend to other things.as always, the dialogue is masterful, the pacing was good. i definately recomend this to any and everyone.",1,113
"a ring of endless light review, by kristina: i thought this book was very good.it has a slow start ,but has a good ending.this book helps show that even everday,normal people have struggles.the story helps us understand how animals can help people with their promblems.this is a great book for people who like animals to read.",1,56
"interesting facts presented: i read aloud to first and second graders. i am always looking for a different type of book to keep their interest. i have not read this to them yet, but i plan to shortly. i this book is not only interesting, but interactive with their young minds.",1,51
"great series: transmetropolitan is a great series, it's filled with quite a bit of punky, quirky, and deadly sci-fi elements, it's got great coloration and it seems quite well written. my only issue with it is that the main character seems almost completely ridiculous at times, making some of the issues unbelieveable. i suppose if you just distance reality, and don't take it seriously, it's quite the entertaining read.",1,69
"it's okay,not bad: alex again. j.k. has another fascinating book. maybe you don't, but i like the reptile idea.snakes are cool! chapter sixteen is when you get parts of the puzzle solved.",1,32
"sliders 3rd season: the packaging is a bit odd, but i can live with it. the seller could have removed some fingerprints, but the discs play just fine. already watching it...",1,31
"really cool!: plain and simple...i'm a writer, i loved it, and i will own the whole series. i'm also 40 years old and not ashamed to say i really like edward cullen along with the rest of his family, even rosalie who can't stand bella. there were a few things stephanie did repeatedly that drove me nuts being i'm a writer myself, but otherwise she made a good story and changed my perception of vampires. mind you...i still love blade and the whole concept to him ridding the world of ""bad"" vamps, but i really appreciate what stephanie did with the cullens and them being ""vegetarians"".",1,106
"one of the best books for the mathematically literate: over the last 25 years, i have read dozens of investment books and this is the best. (ben graham is a close second, but is dated and turgid.)please don't buy this book as it gives away too many secrets!successful investment means long term thinking, some financial knowledge and a little mathematical ability. if you have these and some discipline, then this is the best way to take control of your own destiny. be aware that the book requires you to think and to take account of things like the assumptions made behind the mathematical workings. i spent hundreds of hours creating and fine tuning spreadsheets based on this book. every hour was well worth while.there is no short cut to successful investment: this book avoids hype and gives a remarkable tutorial for the diy investor who wishes to outperform an index.",1,150
"wow!: i was shocked. i put the cd in and was delighted with the first track. after that it only got better this cd is quite possibly the best album i have ever listened to. the 140+ bpm and vocals are what got me hooked, i'm a sucker for fast music. if you too enjoy fast paced music with strong female vocals this is the cd for you.",1,68
"bay area mack down: take this album for what it is. it is the pimps early bootleg, bay area underground, rap. old beats with better than average rhymes. but if you love too $hort, you need to own it...",1,39
"great book--i don't drive anywhere in colorado without it.: this is a very handy book. it's arranged by road name and by stretch of road--if you find yourself on, say, i-70 westbound from denver, go to the table of contents and you'll quickly find something like ""i-70, denver to dillon reservoir."" go to that section and you'll find a small map, geological diagrams, and probably a photograph. there's also an introductory chapter that gives an overview of colorado geology and geological history, as well as very clear explanations of geological terms.driving on colorado highways you see some pretty amazing rock formations, and visitors to the state are always asking about them. this book will tell them (and you) anything you might want to know, and explain it clearly. i keep my copy in the car, and consult it often.",1,139
"my daily bread: this book serves as a great guide for turning to the lord at all times, not just during a crises. i recently lost my wife who died of pancreatic cancer. faith and prayer as indicated in this book provide the wisdom and insights need. i expect that the book entitled my daily bread will help me the rest of my life.",1,64

japanese flute: this cd is a wonderful part of any music lover's collection. get lost in the haunting tones of the japanese flute. a great cd to relax to. i definately give this one a 2 thumbs up.,1,38

"dance with the stars: this book is an excellent guide to the spiritual approach to life. it covers all the metaphysical venues but also imparts that deeper view that leads to a joyful, loving life. it is easy to read and appropriate for any level reader.",1,46
"etmr - life is beautiful: 1. humanity: how does guido express the human quality of endurance?2. implications: life is beautiful expresses the need for family strength. what does this mean for today?3. evolution: life is beautiful employs a style that is at first jarring to watch, and then succeeds on its own as a force of comedy. how has this affected cinema since its release in 1998?4. realism: is the game guido plays with his son feasible realistically?5. stageplay: the basic story is one of a man trying to remain optimistic during a time of intense suffering. how does the light-heartedness of the plot change the realistic consequences of the holocaust?",1,111
great paino playing: jon cain does it again with beautiful paino playing of all the animated music. from aladdin to lady and the tramp. takes me back to the movies i love the most.,1,34
"great movie, wish the dvd had some extras: as a budget dvd, i suppose i shouldn't complain. this was one of the first movies i upgraded when i bought my dvd player. however, the only thing that makes this dvd better than the vhs is that you can see it in widescreen format.considering many think this is the penultimate king arthur movie, i would hope that someday the studio would put together a special edition dvd with a few more extras.",1,81
"my favorite, wish was was in kindle: this was a good purchase, fast shipper and am glad that i purchased, but should not have to write so many words",1,29

"very nice...: yes, i purchased this gumball machine a while ago, but not really until now have i started using it. it is very nice compared to the one's you see for sell at the stores. most of the one's i've seen have a metal outside to make it look 'well made' when the inside in just all plasticy. now this one is going to last you awhile. there's just one little problem -- it says ""it takes all coins"" well, let me tell you, it gets quite jammed when you try putting a dime in there. other than that, i'd say it's pretty nice.. it seems to have it's own stand, but even still, they say you can purchase a bigger one to make it taller.. but i think it'll look strange... (you cannot remove the smaller stand).over-all i'd rate this 5/5and yes, i would recommend this to a friend.",1,151
"par excellent.: this disk simply goes beyond excellent vocals- it encorporates orchestra and synth masterfully into a music package that stands out from the rest of anime music. i bought this originally for the first track: ""unyielding wish"", damn good in itself, let alone the rest of the cd. a must purchase for any anime music library.",1,57
"my first garlock but definitely not last......: this was my first dorothy garlock book but i have now read about 15. this book is the beginning of four books that share characters. i love how garlock doesn't abandon her characters and we see how their lives continue. unlike other authors, she changes the setting and creates a whole new world for subsequent books. they can be read in order or they are wonderful stand alone stories. here are the ones in this series:edge of townhigh on a hilla place called rainwaterriver risingi would recommend all of them!!enjoy!",1,97
"pretty, well fitting belt.: bought this as a gift for a friend who always had to borrow a brown belt from me. it is simple and cute. great addition to any outfit, and it is well made.",1,37
"very few first efforts sound this good: buying an artist's first effort, especially one from a band that is not well known, can be risky. however, i find muse's shobiz to be a fairly consistent album and the band itself musically talented. you will not find the typical cd formula here, where 2 or 3 tracks are radio-worthy and the rest of the album is fluff or ""filler"" material. if you find yourself enjoying the sample audio, you can expect the same quality on all tracks. i hesitated using the term ""radio-worthy"" to describe showbiz because these tracks will never ride the american airwaves. the only downside to showbiz is that it's one of those albums you tend to get bored with if you listen to it too often. however, i just dusted mine off and am currently enjoying it again.",1,141
"bowling ball: i got the 12 lb size large, awesome ball...first game with it shot 160...1 month later, shot a 248...worth the 50 bucks...owning your own ball lets you roll consistently every time...it sucks going to the bowling alley and you can't find a ball you like.",1,47
nice stick!: smooth and heavy and came on time and all that--thank you! i hope my kids will learn to use it! i made it a part of their christmas gifts.,1,31
"a brilliant compilation!: this is the quintessential entry-level recording for those keen on exploration of not only some of jobim's greatest tunes, but some of getz' and gilberto's finest performances. nearly every track has you tapping your feet and longing for a martini. much more should be said about this excellent collection, but i'll leave it to the ears. buy it!",1,61
"funny, poignant and thought-provoking: ""pappy jack"" holloway discovers a new breed of mammals on the planet zarathustra. he feels they are sapient but the company that controls the planet, and will lose their rights to the planet if the ""fuzzies"" are sapient, will stop at nothing to prove him wrong. a very good book, that i highly recommend.",1,58
great camra: i have had the dx6340 for about a year.i love it. pictures are as good as 35m. easy to use.unlike some others i have had no problems with the camera door or soft wear or batteries.some people have lead fingers. it is a camera not a bowling ball. i use rechargeabl batteries and get 200 pictures per charge. you need to know how to use the softwear as with any program.my family and friends are amazed at the pictures. the 4x optical zoom works great. only cameras costing a lot more will have this.i am looking forward to buying another kodak digital camera.keep up the good work kodak.,1,110

"getting better: i've ordered this twice, once where i had to contact customer service to get the case sent instead of a single package (which they accomplished very quickly) and a second time where they got it right the first time. what ever problem they had seems to have been resolved. this is a great deal if you use these a lot.",1,62
"this lady sings the blues!: shemekia can belt them out with the best of them. i first got ""wicked"" and knew she was a young singer with a voice that had the power of the older more experienced female blues singers. when i got turn the heat up, her earlier cd, i was impressed with her vocal range, her gospel feel, r&b , all around blues. shemekia is going to be a force on the blues scene so take notice! congratulations on your handy awards, we will be hearing more and more of you shemekia! i would give this a 4 1/2 star rating if there was one. her potential is still climbing, there is great stuff to come.",1,119
"really simple and fun: what is really awesome about this set is that it is absolutely a great starter exercise program. one thing that is true is that there is not a lot of cuing. but the moves are so simple that i don't feel like i missed out on them at all. i absolutely love it, because it feels more like fun/natural dancing than any other cardio dance dvd i own.",1,72

"so great!: this is my first digital camera and i love it! it's small and very easy to use. there's plenty of advanced features to add effects on the computer and different modes which are a lot of fun to mess around with when taking random shots. the battery lasted through several nights of going out (with turning the camera on and off)and the picture quality is fantastic! i would highly recommend this camera to first time buyers, or to anyone who wants a new, easy-to-use one!",1,87
pump works fine: this breastpump matches my expectations.it's easy to clean and easy to use.turning the lever around makes no sense at all so nobody will ever use that feature.,1,30

"hits the mark: wow!this is a great book for the graphic/web designer wanting to learn actionscript. i own or have read many others that don't cover the basics or the thought processes behind writing in a scripting language. most books on this topic started out over my head with little explaination and were accompanied by buggy and/or old code. with clear and consice writing, philip uses the first half of the book to fully explain programming concepts as they pertain to scripting in flash, and then follows up with examples of how to implement these ideas.i can't say enough about how far this book has taken me into the scripting world. kudos to kerman.",1,114
"edge of your sofa thriller!: deadly gold is a classic mystery that encompasses romance, nature, and greed. i flew through the pages, always yearning to know what simmons would throw in next.",1,32
"great service and value: i ordered the item from sf planet on sunday, and i got it on the mail on thursday. very fast service. the cable is as shown in the customer pictures, and other reviews explained, thinner than the original picture, but it gets the job done! i connected it to the optical output of my laptop, and now it recognizes dts and dolby digital, with 5.1 channel audio connected to my a/v receiver! great!",1,77
"a prophetic look at the u.s. in indochina: on second reading 40-plus years after original publication, graham greene's short and masterful novel ""the quiet american"" seems profound and prophetic. (to many of us it seemed arrogant, stereotyped and anti-american in 1957). alden pyle, the quiet american,has been said by greene biographers to be a takeoff of edwin lansdale, the model for william lederer's ""the ugly american,"" a favorable account of america in asia written contemporaneous with greene's novel. today alden pyle could be seen as a character based on the robert mcnamara, maxwell taylor, henry cabot lodge or robert komer of the 1960s. greene's moral vision is as keen here as in any of his novels.",1,116

"my first nin album, the best, and all hard core fans agree.: phm is one of the best albums to ever hit the market including every genre imaginable. i am what you would call a hardcore nin fan. i first bought the album about a year after it came out and literally wore it out. i helped many of my friends get hooked on industrial rock and nin. of reznor's three albums this is my very favorite. definetly worth 6 stars! an album is like a puzzle. it can be put together right and make something beautiful that you can be proud of, or it can be put together to make the ugliest worst looking thing ever seen. reznor is a master at making an album flow but at the same time each track sounds different, unlike pearl jam and their wannabe followers!",1,143
"great album: this band is so under appreciated. they should've sold a ton of cds. all of their releases are excellent. don't just listen to ""if you could only see"". listen to all of the songs. great albums, all of them. this one and sugar are my favorites. head on straight is also good.",1,54
"very good but missing one feature i wanted: i ordered this thinking it would work well and hoping it would also swing the top indepedently from the bottom. i could not tell from the description if it did this. when i assembled it which was realatively easy even with my arthritic hands, it did not swing separate from the legs. the handle in the photo controls the verticle raising and lowering. the lowest setting is a bit high for the standard rocker recliner chair i use it next to but still workable. the highest setting is very high and it is apparent that this was designed to work with a bed that raises more than with a chair or sofa, though it can with the latter if a bit high. the bottom wheel area is less high than many of the tables i have seen but still did not fit under my chair. a good and solid product in all, but if you need the top to swivel without the legs not the right choice for you.",1,177
take it from a mom!: bought this because we were having problems conceiving ... use quite a few of the recipes. don't know if it really helped but i'm a mom to a 1 year old!!!oh i gave it 4 stars because .. well we couldn't afford a lot of the ingredients.,1,52

a very powerful story.: this book was very good. i would recommend it to anyone. it really opens your eyes to how some people were treated. it also has a very good story line and kept me guessing until the very end. it was one of the best books i've ever read.,1,52
flight simulator delux: the simulator was delivered quicker than i expected. all parts work as advertised. my problem is my graphics card. i need to up date it. the simulator is slow and jerky. i will review it again when i get the card.overall i am very satisfied.,1,48
"flat out incredible: as a long time flash developer and having used actionscript 1.0 extensively, i have really benefitted from this book. colin answers so many questions about best practices and takes an extremely practical approach to flash development - obviously born of considerable experience. his explanation of oop is very good as well. i can't recommend this book enough. just get it - it has the answers you're looking for.",1,71
"the best western in years: i'd given up on westerns since such pitiful attempts as ""posse,"" ""young guns"" and ""bad girls."" that is, until i saw ""gunfighter's moon."" this is a fantastic western with fantastic acting from lance henriksen. the plot was intelligent and moving, particularly the ending. this henriksen guy is brilliant. an actor to look out for.",1,59

thumbs up: this book is is amazing..i've read it several times and have recommended it to a lot of other people who have found this read equally amazing..,1,28
"amazingly powerful flash at a great price!: i own two of these, and frequently use them for portraits and product shots (on and off camera). they have a good, solid construction and a very easy-to-use design. the metal hot shoe and locking clip provide security during use. the power of these flashes, coupled with the flexibility of the swiveling head will give you more creative room to work. the use of standard aa-size batteries (nimh recommended) keeps costs down and eliminates the complications of trying to hunt down odd-ball batteries. i would also recommend the sto-fen omni diffuser for an added touch of softness when using this flash direct.sto-fen omew omni-bounce diffuser",1,112

"the classic--what did you expect?: i just had one comment to make. several people here have complained about sartre's verbosity and repetitiveness. well, sartre was a french intellectual and ontologist, and a philosophical student of husserl and heidegger. none of these influences is likely to predispose one to brevity. what did they expect--ogden nash, or monty python?",1,57

"terrific score from rupert ""escape"" holmes: rupert holmes (famous for his #1 hit ""escape"") does an excellent job with his first theatrical score, the tony-winner ""mystery of edwin drood"". the show, based on the unfinished book by charles dickens, is basically a whodunit, with multiple endings based on each audience's preferences. the cast, headed by betty buckley, george rose, cleo laine and howard mcgillin, is terrific. the score is fast-moving & fun!best tracks include:there you are [the terrific opening number]a man could go quite madtwo kingsmenmoonfallthe wages of sinboth side of a coindon't quit while you're aheadfinale: the writing on the wallthis score may not be filled with theatrical standards, but the songs are generally excellent & merit repeat listenings.",1,120
"yay for first review: when i bought this album a few months back in a local store in boston, i wasn't sure what to expect. i didn't know much of l'arc~en~ciel's early work, but, i decided to take a chance.after listening to it a couple times, i decided it was okay. but, it grew on me, and now, its one of my favorite albums (i don't have many cds anyways, but that's beyond the point).my favorite songs off the albums are in the air (hyde's voice makes me go all bubbly-fangirly, and the bassline is awesome), and she said, caress of venus, and winter fall.if you are a fan of l'arc~en~ciel, i definately reccommend getting this album.",1,117

"if you get one ken boothe cd...: i'd say this is the one to get. ""freedom street"" is one of the most passionate rocksteady classics i've ever heard. boothe is more famous for a kind of sappy lovers style. that stuff is ok, but nothing compared to when ken cranks up and belts out, ""then take off these chains, from off our feet!"" the rest of this cd couldn't possibly measure up, but it's mostly in a rougher style than his other albums. if you're a rocksteady fan, this is what you're looking for from ken boothe.",1,97

"great book of speculation psychology: i wish i had read this book fifteen years ago. it is the fictional account of the great stock speculator jesse livermore. the author presents his life starting from the bucket shops through his great gains and losses on the actual stock and commodities markets. there are so many pearls of wisdom in this book that can be gleaned by the typical (loser)investor that the book will probably pay for itself by avoiding the first bad trade. i am only giving it four stars because it is dated, but the psycholgy and behaviours has not chnaged since then, so it is still valuable for today.",1,110
"love that orange: received watch 2 weeks earlier than promised, of course the promise date gave them a month! so basically it was less than 2 weeks. the watch is as perfect looking in person as in the closeups online. the outer dial ratchets firmly and accurately. it is rich looking and has the expensive heft you would expect in any watch over $100. i am very pleased with the looks and quality.",1,73
"fantastic sci-fi: this has a decent storyline and plot development. though most of the characters are static, some do grow into an anchor for the show and its life.",1,29

"a very original and mystical love story!: the author done something remarkable: he has succeeded in adapting a great sufi classic, ""the parliament of the birds"" by atar in the contemporary world of pop music. it is a highly enjoyable read and yet very profound. i loved it!",1,48
"surrealistic treasure found.: based on the fernando arrabal's play, ""fando y lis"" is a journey of tortuous love in the middle of an unreal puzzle.doomed by the controversy, it was banned just after the release in the acapulco festival (1967). now it's available on dvd, a perfect oportunity (to many of us) to watch for the very first time this movie.warning: (no fake blood were used in this film)",1,69
"great small knife, very high quality: this knife is just the right size and easy to open and use. the kershaw knives are the very best.",1,26
"own brand: the birthday massacre is a one of a kind band. there music feels goth, with hints of electronica(but not to be confused with neo-goth, or eletronic/goth), and fused with the odd flavor of 80s pop. intresting to say the lest. there compareable to no one in style much like mindless self indulgence. when bands like these come around its hard not to take notice cause such orginal sounds turns into such ear candy. its a virgin sound to your ears and to that asepc its a true treat. there closest compareable sounds are that of a zeromancer clashed with london after midnight. more so the later then the former. the only issue is that some of the music although catchy, gets bland after numerous listens. i dont like to plug other bands, however if your taste brought you this far i suggest giving london after midnight a try...a bit more darker with a harder male vocal lead. despite both bands showing clear differences they still go hand and hand it so seems.",1,174
"not bad at all: to judge this cd means to judge it only based on lyrics, beat, content, and flow. i believe for his first album he has much talent. with time he will be the bomb! i will buy this at the first chance i get. i love several of the songs on the album. when you can dig more than five songs on an album these days you got a legitimate cd. keep doing your thing man. the cd is grooving. can't wait for the second one.",1,89
definitely recommend: lots of fun and very challenging for all ages. i only don't like the time it takes to set up the card's configuration and that the cars sometimes aren't stable enough on the playing surface. this is a very addictive game. love it.,1,45
great lil sander: ive sanded 2 vehicles with this sander and still works great. im sure that it will perform well on wood as well. with the right paper. has much more power than i expected. my former sander was a matco that cost better than 200. and it out performs it easily.,1,53
"comfort/quality: i am ordering another set, different color.excellent from shipping, washing, sleeping like a dream",1,15
"decent.: it does its job, but it smells sooooo horrible. i prefer using a cotton swab instead of my fingers, because it leaves a bad medicine-like smell (fortunately, it fades after a bit). it's not really creme/lotion like... it's more of a watery, diluted creme.i've only use it for a week and i use it once after i shower and once before i sleep. so far, the irritation/itching has been minimal. does its job, for the most part.",1,78
nice chest: these are great for storing small items but beware that if you use them to store silver they will coat and tarnish yellow from the lacquer used to seal the wood. they are nicely made otherwise.,1,38

"great performance but raw video quality: the performances in this set are fantastic. however, the video quality of the apollo performance is very raw. the producers of this set should have put a disclaimer on the package, or should have done some remastering of the footage, as led zeppelin did for their dvd set several years ago.but the performance is great. he starts out with a version of ""if i ruled the world."" not the funk that may be expected from the godfather but none the less, a good version. as the show goes on, it gets funkier and "" i got the feeling"" is james brown at his best.i haven't had a chance to view the documentary from this set but i have seen it before on vh1 and it is quite good.overall, great stuff but don't expect 21st century quality.",1,142
"the greatest american slacker satire: simply put, this piece-de-resistance of cinematic masterpieces has earned its reputation. there is no other movie that creates the same aura of brilliance kevin smith manages. its perfect. its acting is great, the direction is superfluous, and the screenplay is magnanimously pulchritudinous.""that's a beautiful ring sir"" ""yes, its my college ring, graduated cum laude in 1969"" ""that's interesting i hope to cum loud in a 69 myself""",1,72
"hidden gem: at first glance, this morally complex film seems to be merely uninteresting, but by looking at the cast alone, it warrants a second glance. ben affleck, vin diesel and other familiar faces appear in this film.somewhere between the lines of right and wrong lies reality. this movie is a realistic portrayal of one man trying to make money and learning that there is no such thing as the easy way. caught in a web of lies, he struggles to find his way out of...the boiler room",1,88
"a small town primer: this is a memoir and a darned good one. you become part of a small town named new auburn, wi as mr. perry invites you into his world and .... you want to come. he returns to the area of his childhood and expresses his love of the area in many ways. there are many wonderful tales of small town life and touching words by the author. the whole book is very good, but the last 3 chapters are the best: oops - penultimate- and sarah. the last chapter is sad and winds the story up in a satisfying manner.",1,104
"wonderful songs.: i chose the high rating because he is a wonderful writer. his singing however, leaves a little to be desired....just saying.",1,23
"recommended by my dermo: my dermo recently recommended this product to me to help keep certain areas of my body dry (i am prone to developing itching rashes during my workouts, especially under my arms.) i do not need the anti-fungal component, but the gel drying to powder is awesome - far less messy than powders and it is quite effective at reducing my itching.",1,65

"funny girl: i purchased this as a gift, but assume that it was satisfactory as i have not heard otherwise.",1,20
pirates aboard: this is a good book to read for cruisers. it gives the mariner a heightened sense of awareness that must be taken when anchoring in some places. having a gun aboard for protection is not the answer and one can see why in the reading.,1,47

"the genesis record: i purchased this book titled ""the genesis record"" by henry morris due to recommendation by fellow bible teachers as an excellent source of commentary regarding the most controversial book of the bible. my was i amazed at the intense spirit filled reflection of the book of genesis by henry morris. although he has gone home to be with the lord, mr. morris has left behind a treasure trove of in-depth information that will aid any serious student of the book of genesis especially needed in this age where there is rare good expository bible teaching found.sincerely,george h. mitchler",1,101
"absolutely amazing mini series: this is one of my all time favorite books, so i was skeptical that the movie would be as good, but was pleasantly surprised at how closely they followed the book. it is an amazing mini series, extremely well made and the characters were true to the book. i would recommend this mini series to any ken follett fan or anyone who loves pillars of the earth.",1,71
review by son of author: resolves the current conflict whereby saints call themselves sinners. in non-theological language. this book (my father's book) has changed many lives. this book is a product of real life experiences.,1,35
"works well: i bought this based on the reviews. yes, it does hurt some, but no, it's not unbearable. what you have to remember is that it's pulling your hairs out, not just cutting them off at the surface. so if you feel pain strongly, don't bother with it. otherwise, it's great. i have slow-growing, fine hair, so i only need to use it every 3-4 weeks. i have to let the hair grow to about 1/2"" long before it works well on me, but that's because the hair is so fine that it needs the length to be able to catch hold of them. i definately recommend it.",1,109
"not bad: i bought these to use on trips to india that included long flights and layovers. i got a pair of koss over-the-ear style headphones for use when i wanted some noise to filter in (flight announcements, etc) but i also wanted a pair to block out the world. the sparkplugs did exactly that. the foam inserts expand within your ear to provide a snug fit that keeps out external noise. i agree with other reviewers that the bass is a bit lacking, but as has been suggested, simply blocking the holes on the outside of the buds corrects that completely. my only complaint is that after a while, one of my ears always got a bit sore. might be because i have pretty small ears that all buds have a hard time staying in. regardless, these are worth having. for longer term use, and for when i don't need the sound cancelling, i liked the koss portable over-the-ear set.koss ksc75 portable stereophone headphones",1,165
"because we are poor, must we be vicious?: joyce carol oates is a novelist of the first order. her novel of postwar detroit (really of postwar america), them, is her best. nothing she has written, before or since (even including her newest, the fictionalized biography of marilyn monroe) brings the reader the emotional power, or the superb prose of oates' immortal classic. readers who read them when it was first published years ago deserve to study the new modern library edition. readers unfamiliar with the best of oates should run, not walk, to their bookstores or their personal computers and order this classic. it is as simple as that. them is a masterpiece.",1,113

"good so far: good book so far (chapter 7), and has created some pretty good discussion in my men's group. it's relevant and worth your time.",1,26
"good ideas but it's definitely a future hollywood movie.: this is really not a bad book. i realize that he is manipulating his name and writing with intent to eventually make money off of a hollywood box office hit but this story makes you think. his past books didn't really do that. homelessness is running rampant all of our country and the majority of the u.s population (270 million) don't think twice about it, only that they don't wish this terrible misfortune to fall upon them. but many of these people didn't take to life on the streets because they wanted to. the reasons are diverse. grisham is a good writer overall and i think for the first time he has attempted to make his large fanfare think about deeper issues than just about courtroom procedure, etc. i hope he continues on this track.",1,144

"good janet effort: at one point i thought this album was the best cd i ever owned and i loved the music on it and some of it helped me deal with my own issues and for that i will always love this album cause it was one of the first albums i could identify with. but as time has passed, other artists have written better lyrics and music about personal issues though i give it to janet for starting the trend with dance divas getting personal too in their music. the music on this cd is really really good, but as a whole album it's hard to listen to now because though i always thought this cd was the most timeless janet cd out of them all and a good blend of old school and contemporary r&b/pop though several tracks are beginning to sound dated, it's still worth a listen.",1,151
very well written: this is a very well written book on the subject of complex analysis. the text explains the concepts in enough detail that the reader has enough of a grasp to work the problems at the end of the section. the problems are challenging but not impossible. overall this is an excellent book.,1,55

"hasnt left the cd player yet: this cd is solid all the way through, some good dirty american rock and roll, searing guitar licks, heavy drum beats, and catchy lyrics keep you rocking.. the former workhorse crew lightens things up a bit yet continue to keep cranking out some good stuff.... its a must have for anyones collection",1,58
"one of the best movies ever!: i have had baseketball in my posession for about 9 months now, and i can honestly say it is my favorite movie. i have watched it at least 150 times, and i made all my buds watch it too. we all love it. trey parker and matt stone are both brilliant in this film. i loved it so much, i had to get orgazmo and cannibal! the musical too! they are all great movies, and i recommend that you try to see the other two if you liked baseketball!",1,95

"a fastmoving, suspenseful psychological thriller: a friend of the author recommended this book to me. the story is about a psychiatrist, dr. more, who is being harassed. it starts out with impersonating phone calls and flat tires, but soon escalates to the murder of dr. more's wife, while he slept beside her. dr. more's fight to prove his innocence will no doubt have your undivided attention and will keep you guessing until the very end. i recommend this book to everyone. i am looking forward to reading more titles from this promising author, michael mcgrath.",1,95
"great recording: i must admit, dave grusin is one of my favourite musicians. i alway liked the ""original"" two-channel recording. but this dts recording gives you even more excitement! once you are addicted to multi-channel music you will hardly accept/like conventional recordings anymore.with this album high quality music goes together with high quality recording...",1,54
"wow, what a neat software: these cd's have been around for years and i never bought them with our first child, but wow what a difference it made for my pre-kindergartner. he is spelling, reading, etc. and he is addicted to the pc (in a good way). highly recommended.",1,49

"absolutely one of the best movies of our time.: each time i watch this film, i discover even more meaning. based on ""the wrong man"" thesis, this work is artful, poetic (especially redd's narrative), poignant, and riveting. it will undoubedly move you and leave you with a victorious feeling.",1,49
"can't wait to own the dvd...: this is not a sequel to the first movie... rather, it's a follow-up... calling it a sequel seems to cheapen it somewhat, it's like spiderman 2 or some dumb-arsed action flick... ethan hawke and julie delpy are superb, they have such wonderful chemistry together and the dialogues so spontaneous, it almost feels as if they are living in the real world and we are living in a movie... oh when and when is ""before sunset"" coming to dvd? i need it! and i don't even type in captialized letters for the most part!",1,99
"have not read this title, but ...: i have continued to keep the 2nd edition close by at work. the authors have put maximum in minimum of words, concise and truly useful from a trainee's point. the articles are brife, and yet complete and pictures are highly illustrative. with extensive new information added to the field of nephrology every day, a new edition of this masterpiece is sorely needed. i will wait for the new edition to hit the bookshelves. do the authors have any such plans?",1,87
"wonderfull start for person with no idea of clicker training.: this book is very helpfull and informative to people completely new to clicker training. with my ever failing voice i simply cannot repeat the same command with the same tone or pitch, thus i was incapable to come through to my dog, i was not credible. clicker training with the help of this book made training fun again! this book among others also was quite encuraging! to me at least.i must agree though with a fellow reviewer below that one thing that is missing is a show training chapter. i would also say that further reading of related books would perhaps expand my skill, but just as a tryout or for begginers this books is fine!",1,126
"great classic: this is a great book for all kids. i loved it, and now i love reading it to my nephew!",1,22
"a good read....: although the plot moves rather quickly, i found this book rather enjoyable. i admired the way the author attempted to highlight the sometimes unwarrented suspicion towards individual people based on thier ethnicity.although a fictional plot, i enjoyed the way the author incorporated true macedonian history within it. however, i think that the quotations presented before every chapter directed towards the ethnicity of modern macedonians would have been more effective if aleksandar donski's work was not exclusively used.all in all, i found it to be a good read.",1,90
"nice: the poster was as expected. the size was great and the sketch was smart, accurately representing what might constitute the unconscious.",1,22
"great actors, great acting and location and wonderful music.: it would be hard to beat this. young amy irving and richard dreyfuss giving superb performances. san francisco is the perfect setting for this movie and then there is the very beautiful movie. this is both a treat for the eyes as well as for the ears.",1,56
"great movie can't wait for the blu ray: i have seen this movie 2 times in theaters. optimus prime turns bad ass in this one when he says ""we will kill them all"". the wreckers are great as well as sideswipe and mirage. i strongly recommend.",1,46
"good for the price: i needed a pretty big memory card, but the reload and storage speeds were not a factor. this being the case, this card has been perfect so far. holds a lot of pics and videos, and doesnt really take too long to store em and be set for the next picture/ vid.",1,56

"beautifully written: this isn't the usual type of book that i would read and in fact i found it incredibly boring for the first hundred or so pages. what kept me reading was the way the book was written rather than the plot itself. simple sentences had so much meaning and depth, it really made me think. as the novel moves on and some plot finally begins to develop i became intrigued in the characters. throughout the book i was not able to take sides with one character over another. yet, i kept reading because i wanted to learn more about each one of their attributes and the reasons of why they did certain things. i was more interested in the character development rather than the plot to be honest. in fact the ending really fell flat.",1,137
"awesome movie!!!: i love skateboarding, so i just had to check this out. i rented it and watched it. awesome. cameos by real pros, humor, and best of all, good skating. buy this if you love skateboarding and/or comedy.",1,39

"check out this band!: i first saw the hunger open up for kiss on the 96 reunion tour. normally, opening bands mean it's time to get a beer. the hunger seriously rocked though! they had an incredible energy and, i think, made the most of their opportunity. where are they now? i don't know - but if you get the chance to see them i recommend it. this cd is a good debut - it got some radio air time. where are they?",1,83
"highly recommened, but needs more health details: this book is a very good primer for the new bird owner. i would have liked a little more detailed health information, perhaps including some professional photos instead of just the drawings. it's primary strength is the behavioral info,which is, of course, sally blanchard's field of expertise.",1,54
"an amazing shalamar collection!: i had to write a review for this hits collection because i completely disagree with the other sole reviewer. first of all, it is very well remastered. sounds superb! second of all, songs are not chopped off half-way through them. it is true... these are not the 12-inch dance-floor versions. they are the single versions!!! but, they are not abruptly edited, as the other reviewer may have led you to believe. ultimate collection has a well-represented collection of tracks from shalamar's discography, even a few tracks from the pre-howard hewett period. the cd does not get five stars from me, however, because there are too many selections coming from the synthesizer-heavy late-'80s. perhaps 17 tracks on an album is too much of a good thing sometimes! otherwise, i have no complaints!!!",1,135
"worth the money: this item is definately worth the price.the quality is great and it amazingly increased my night time capabilities. although the light enhancement isn't that important and as great then the infared.anyways, this item is great for its price.",1,41
"shocking ending: very good movie if you have the slightest interest or knowledge of nuclear physics. if you know nothing of this subject matter you can still watch it and enjoy it, but to really get the full magnitude of what happens at the end you have to have some knowledge of nuclear physics.",1,54

"larry elder is the real deal: i am coming in late on mr. elder's thoughts regarding america, but after reading this book, most all of what he has to say...i've already thought about at one point or another.that's not to say it's just another ""rehash""...quite the contrary. larry speaks his mind, using common sense approaches and everyday analogies to show each of us that we don't have to labor under the banner of ""victimology"", whatever race we are.he states that we are in control of ourselves, and that we should be accountable to ourselves first and foremost.there is no free ride in mr. elder's book, or his rhetoric. and that's a refreshing change of pace from all that we hear and see today.victicrats, beware!",1,124

"exploring the wilds: a cacophony of drums and electronic noises rushes us from song to song, each of which inexplicably takes its time to get where it's going. this time-confusion is exploited to great effect, leaving the listener a bit off-kilter for a time after listening. margaret fiedler's vocals are outstandingly understated, as usual, getting lost in the mix only when necessary. fun and confusing.",1,65
good gift: soft on the inside and fits very well. husband loved the gift. the artwork on the back is awesome. :),1,22
"the best bsc video!: i love books and movies about christmas. there are so many things going on with the members. kristy wants a baseball mitt for christmas and has to do chores around the house to pay for half of it(but isn't she supposed to be a millionaire?!); stacey is sneaking holiday treats because she has diabetes and misses them and dawn is getting on her case for it and all of them together are volunteering at the hospital and planning a christams party for the sick kids as well as their baby sitting charges. fun things they did on the side were playing christmas carols on the piano, having a christmas breakfast, the party, seeing santa at the mall and trying to do a secret santa though it was a disaster. a good film.",1,136
"great music!!!: this is one of my favorite piano books. most of the songs and themes are included in nice arrangements, although i do wish that they'd included some songs such as ""strange thing mystifying"" and ""simon zealots."" other than that, i highly recommend it.",1,45
"merlin the magician: i can remember when i was in my teens (it was like 1983-84) when i first heard the song ""merlin the magician"" it was being playing on a collage radio station at the time, & i was playing around with my tape deck & i had recorded the last minute & 15 sec. of the song. i ended up really liking the piece that i had recorded. & for 30 years & i mean 30 years i had wanted to know the name of the song & who does that song! i resent got myself an i-phone & i installed an app called ""shazam"" (it listens to a song that is being played & it gives you the artist & song title)& when it showed me the title ""merlin the magician"" by rick wakeman, i said to my wife, ""i hope this is correct"" cause i been looking for such a very long time for the song title!!!& now i'm so glad that i have this cd now!!ronald schultzronald815@yahoo.com",1,172
"beautiful performances flawed by poor recording: it is frustrating to listen to performances given with the care and precision that robert shaw and solists bring to them, and realize that you are listening through a ""fog"" of either poor mixing or placement of soloists too far away from the chorus and orchestra. karl dent can hardly be heard above the ensemble and the chorus' flawless diction is muddy. renee fleming's ravishing solo work is best heard through headphones because on speakers, the orchestra predominates. it is the miking at time of performance or something else that makes me wish this recording were reissued and remixed?",1,105
"fascinating: this a very interesting book, and will give you information you probably never knew... some entries are a little glossed over, but for the most part it will keep you busy for a while. it doesn't discuss information from the the most recent novels (like the 2nd han solo trilogy) or the phantom menace of course, but oh well.",1,60
"good value pack for 3 films: the video looks slightly better than an upscaled dvd. if you already have the original dvds, it may not be worth upgrading unless you find it on sale. but if the films are new to you, then the gift set is a good value.",1,50
good quality: my 3 year old picked this out and loves it. i think the quality may be slightly nicer and more durable than the (non-wood) melissa and doug puzzles we've been getting.,1,33
delta jt 160 jointer: jointer is what i needed and works as advertised. i would like to see an improvement on the discharge chute. it leaves a lot to be desired dumping shavings on the workbench or floor. other brands are supplied with vacuum connections for collection of cuttings. delta sells them as accessories.,1,54
"this stuff works great!: my teeth are hard to whiten. i really like opalescence because it does a good job in a relatively short time. i was using the 5% before, and for me the 10% is even better because i only need about 2 nights, 3 maximum, for a really good whitening job, then can go months with just a one-night tune-up now and then. so it's lasting me even longer. good product!",1,74
"effective business writing: i find this book very helpful. i feel it is very important to stay abreast of the ""latest"" information about effective writing in the business world as it does change frequently.",1,34
"jerry lee proves he is still the ""king"" of rock and roll: even after 30 plus years of recording (at the point of this set being recorded) ""killer"" still has the licks. while the fact that the original versions of the songs aren't all here (only great balls of fire has an orginal version of it) jerry lee is still bangin' away at the piano. for him to have been able to record such good re-recordings of these songs is amazing especially when you consider all he has been through (see the movie or read his book if you don't know of what i speak). i declare him the true king of rock and roll because he didn't lose his edge like elvis did. the only reason i only gave this 4 stars is because i would have liked more originals also. but that's just my opinion and as dennis miller has said i could be wrong...",1,157
"marty done well: got everything you'd want here, no complaints. early at his prime and pleanty of him. only critique is this version of ""el paso"" is the shorter one, missing the stanza between shooting the wild young cowboy and heading for rosa'a back door. i dunno why, maybe timing for radio which was a serious consideration back in the day. might have liked the ""el paso"" spinoffs that he wrote later, but this is a nice compilation for marty fans, especially on a long trip.",1,86
"geat product!: the cover works great. it gives nice protection to my grill from rain. the material is of high quality. the sandy color looks nice. there are four buckles to tie the cover to the grill so that it will not be blown away by strong wind. the only drawback of the cover is that with the cover on, very strong wind can push the whole grill down. but i guess that is the case for any cover. just have to find a right place to put my grill so that it will not fall down. overall, i like the product.",1,102
groovy and great: my 5 year old daughter has a lot of the accessories and 6 of the dolls. they are terrific and exceptionally durable. i would make the purchase of these over plastic toys any day reguardless of price.,1,40
"aberdeen - - music with power: i think aberdeen's live performaces are much better than the album, this band sounds like a cross between cream and social distortion, i like bands who have self-titled albums, i think this band will be around for a long time, people seem to like their live sound. i give aberdeen 4 stars but would give their performance 5 stars",1,65
"great game, too much static: this is a great game even though it could have been slightly better. for starters the fields look as if they were rushed, the sound crackles when engaged in heavy combat. now for the pros. the enemys can be like 20x bigger than you and you can be fighting up to 8 enemies at once and defeat them all at once, so it gives you a sense of collosal power. some of the combat gets so heavy with tornado attacks that it is almost impossible to see what you are attacking. the dark tones and dim lighting in the game gives you a sense of mystery and danger. no matter how strong you get enemies from this versions feilds and dungeons can't be beaten with just on hit. for those you have played the first one the magic goes up to level 3.",1,148
"the goal: i had to read this book for my operation management class at uncc.i think this book was wonderful, since i enjoyed every page of. i believe that eli tolerate demonstrates his genius both as a thinker and as a teacher with ""the goal"". as in any other well-written novel, the goal examines issues in dispute which create conflicts. the operational concepts that he presents are revolutionary in their practicality and common-sense approach. this book is presented with a storyteller's passion for detail, while still driving the key learning points of the theory. this makes sticking with it to the end much easier, which is important, as several key concepts are not revealed until the final pages. every organization can benefit from the concepts presented in ""the goal"". eli goldratt has written a novel in which he provides an analysis of those concepts as applied in a fictional company. he has a cast of characters, a plot, and a context. he relies heavily on dialogue to advance the narrative.",1,170
star rocks!: just picked up the cd by accident. first track--the ultimate soundtrack to a seductive striptease. a really creative effort.,1,21
"a little messy, but your teeth feel so clean: i am only giving this product a 4 out of 5 due to the mess it makes. it could be my lack of coordination skills, but we purchased this for my son who recently got braces...well needless to say it makes a mess out of my bathroom and whoever is using it. lol i think it is a product that takes some getting used to.",1,74
"great little grill!!: this is the best little grill. i had to replace my old george foreman and this was a perfect replacement. i especially love the removable plates, it makes cleaning such a breeze. i definitely recommend this product",1,40
"pollyanna the sequal: almost as good as the first. it was delightful after watching the movie over a dozen times, to find out what happens next. although predictable, it was still a fun, light read.",1,35
"good toy overall: my son is 18 months and is the size of a three year old. so finding a age and size appropriate play-n-ride required a little more research than normal, but it was worth every minute. he enjoys the play-n-ride and plays with it often. it suits his size and age,my only problem is the handle\back pulls off too easily. overall i would recommend this toy to others.",1,70
"excellent: an excellent beginning ""invitation to the christian spiritual life"" for those searching for a closer walk with god!",1,19
"very fun game: i love this game. it is very fun. it can play 1 - 4 players on wi-fi but i have not yet tried it. it has many levels to unlock to bring hours of entertainment. you start out with picking from four main characters, shrek, fiona, donkey, and gingerbread man. as you go along, you will unlock more courses and more characters. it reminds of the mario kart format, but it isn't quite as good as the mario kart ds. this was appealing to me because new it was under $30 and so many psp games are not that price new unless they are not that good. my 8 year old daughter had a good time playing it too.",1,122
"advisable: i had watched the other 2 movies of this trilogy, for that reason i couldn't stop to buy this to complete it.if somebody doesn't know this trilogy, i recommend it, it is simply remarkable.",1,35
"religious george: if you want to read a book of about 90% of new material then this is the book...keep in mind it may not be a biography in terms of the man's life or artistic output...it's very much about his religion mainly the india type religion aka yogi's, marehishie? ...and how all that came to be and why it became to be and just how involved george was into all that...brief discussions on the backlash in his involvement and most of all the meaning of his involvement on popular culture as we know it...most people are aware of yoga, chanting, indian religion and 95% of that is the responsibility of george harrison's involvement...but keep in mind when purchasing this book the book's main focal point is the religious aspect of his lfe...with a very very brief over-view in the beginning chapters.",1,142

"bogie really shines in classic film noir mystery.: bogie and lizabeth scott give outstanding performances in this film noir classic. murder, romance, dead bodies everywhere - you really need to stay glued to follow the clues. this film is in the same mold as ""maltese falcon"" and ""the big sleep"". absolutely top notch!",1,53
"professional grade pet comb ~: i would have liked to know the size of this comb without having to go off site. for others who want to know, it's slightly over 5"" long. my search was for a comb that is going to last without having to replace it every year because the tines started breaking, and i believe this one is going to last.it's stainless steel and it combs through most junk dogs, even little dogs, get on their faces. mine is a maltese, for instance, so he's got the brown stuff from his eyes that white dogs get and this comb gets through the gunk without too much fuss, especially if i spray it slightly first to wet it a little.the christensen line is expensive but the quality is there and the tools are made to last.",1,139

"a classic if ever there was one!: this book is great! not only does it give me a feel of how life might be durinng end times, but the series only gets better! i learned so much and was inspired to read revealation in my bible! this book will not bore you and was an ingenious idea. i won't give anything away to you, all i can say is read it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1,71
"if your looking for a good crue album...: greatest hits is the most suitable title for this album. released in 1998, motley crue's greatest hits is a great compilation album for any die-hard crue fan. on the album you'll find hits such as: kickstart my heart, dr. feelgood, and smokin' in the boys room. if your into the heavier crue stuff, you'll find hits such as too fast for love, looks that kill, and shout at the devil! if your looking for a good variety of motley crue songs on a single album, then motley crue: greatest hits is the album for you.",1,103
"brilliant ghost story: well most of the time i am pretty disappointed with ghost stories but this one is the best i have ever seen by far. kidman is fantastic ... one scene in particular was very, very creepy indeed :) ... hauntingly beautiful and chilling all round :)",1,49

coffee maker: i perched a bunn coffee maker through amazon from wet beans. it was a used unit and had been cleaned and in good shape. it came with two pots and a plastic pitcher for filling it and complete documentation. i am happy with it and it works well but they should have included the spring that is used for cleaning it. the spring cost so little but i had to order it from another source. ron,1,78

"the twisted window: the twisted window is about a girl named tracy lloyd who agrees to help a boy named brad who acts like he is from winfield high but is from alberqurky, mexico to rescue a girl named mindy. what tracy does not know is why brad wants to take mindy. i enjoyed the book because duncan made it interesting, exciting and so you won't put the book down. it did have a slow begging but as you read aon it got exciting.",1,84
"country as well as folk.: i am glad to see that certain folksingers such as woodyguthrie are now also considered country singers. after all,some folk music is traditional nonpopular country music, andsome folk music is not country music.",1,38

"good, but often overshawdowed or overlooked: a bit more violent than i appreciate, but worthy of a viewing or two. cate owns it, but the others also do well. this film is far, far, better than shakespeare in love, which is a vulgar, tasteless, obsurdity. cate should have won the oscar, no question. no offense to gwenyth. at least elizabeth did well in the nominations department.",1,66
a very pleasant read: having taken vacations yearly to lancaster county all through my childhood and often in my adulthood i was especially drawn to this book.it did not disappoint.it is beautifully written and filled with charming characters and full of knowledge about the plain people. i can't wait to finish the series so i can find out the ending of all these dramas.i have to know what happens to people who are so well defined they make you feel you know them in life.read this enjoy it and you'll agree.,1,91
kickboxing bag: my son does karate and this is great for him to practice his kicks. it is adjustable for his height.,1,22
"the dominant blonde: this book was great! the plot was very good and you could really start to sympathize with the lydia. it is an easy and light read if you are looking for something that doesn't make you think. also, it is fun. i highly recommend it. i have passed it on to my co-workers (women of course) and they thought it was good too.",1,66
"terrific item: this holiday we wound up hosting more parties than i would have thought possible, so my husband and i purchased this item and the similar deni 3-section server. both trays were great at keeping food warm, and more than one guest swore they were going to rush off and buy them as well. they clean up easily and were the hits of the party. my one complaint is that on the temperature dial, the ""off"" setting does not work. the only way to turn the unit off is to unplug it from the wall. (it seems to work fine on the 3-tray unit so it's apparently a fluke.) still, i'm not the type to leave heating appliances plugged in when not in use to begin with, so i'm not overly concerned. you probably shouldn't leave these running unattended in the first place. fabulous purchases and highly recommended.",1,149
"truly one of the finest american movies!: i have to agree with the majority of reviewers who rave about this film. the story of one night of cruising in a 1962 california city hasn't aged a bit in the 33 years since it was first released. i ""saw"" this movie several times as a kid, but it's meaningless until after you've been out of high school for a number of years. the cast is great, the script is great, and the music is great if you are a fan of early rock & roll. ron howard is a fine director, but moviegoers have really missed out since he quit acting. young mackenzie phillips is fabulous. the scene where charles martin smith attempts to buy whiskey is classic. very enjoyable.",1,129
"use with broad brimmed hat or bare headed: the illustration doesn't show it, but the coleman insect head net has a camo pattern fabric section for the top of the head. matches my woodland camo outdoor clothing.if you are doing hunting, wildlife photography, or such, you will be able to get some benefit from the green mesh somewhat obscuring your european ancestry white face which is a dead giveaway in the forest, a highly reflective surface that tells animals that you are not part of the background colors. but a dedicated camo face mask would do better.this item fits well without a hat, certainly. it also fits quite well over my woodland camouflage boonie hat.military boonie & jungle hatsit's simple but well made and there is practically no place in the world (except antarctica or the shores of the arctic ocean) where this wouldn't be useful in season. if you spend time outdoors, even on your (non screened-in) patio, you should consider getting this. flying bugs spoil everything.",1,168
"interesting and different: so often faerie plots wind up contrived adn silly; this one doesn't. it actually is very believeable. eden is a midling sort of heroine; she changes and grows throughout the book and eventually becomes worthy of the title. but that comes at the end, so it hampers the story a bit. hern/hartley/cornelius is superbly written, very strong, yet a touch vulnerable even as a fane lord. the forklore is very well done as are several of the minor characters. perhaps the wrong done is forgiven too easily, too quickly (except of course between the hero & heroine), but it's not much of a detriment. there are a couple of loose ends i'd like to have seen wrapped up. at the climax, i was crying so hard that i couldn't read the page. not perfect, but an exceptional book well worth the read.",1,145
v.g.: the recording of bridget jones: edge of reason was fantastic. i laughed so hard i was practically crying. my life demands that i spend lots of time in my car. the book on tape was a terrific way to enjoy commuting. my favorite character is bridget's boss. the audio does a terrific portrayal of the characters. i thoroughly recommend this sequel to anyone who can really laugh at themselves!,1,70
"really good companion!: when i first bought this book a few years ago i tried it but after a few days lost interest. later that year i found it again between other books i kept in a box and decided to try it again. and yes, it works!it is not a long book, and it will take you maybe one or two days to read it. that being said, i think that it is a great source for those (like me) that like a quick dose of yoga, whether because of time or whatever reason.the exercises within are great, and you can do them wherever you want without the need for a mat or blanket.ideal for traveling.",1,117
"you are not a real buffy fan until you own this album.: the title of my review says it all, if you love buffy and you don't own this album *points finger and shakes it* shame shame on you!!!imho no other tv show other has been able to successfully pull off a musical episode.",1,54

"fun fun fun: what a fun album! while ""sing"" is one of the few carpenters' songs i really don't care much for, the others more than make up for it. ""this masquerade"" absolutely soars. ""jambalaya"" is catchy, and ""yesterday once more"" is a keeper. the oldies medley is great. karen will break your heart singing ""the end of the world"".by the way, ""i can't make music"" is a hard song for me to listen to. in my opinion, it's the most haunting, disturbing lyric karen ever sang. it gives me goose bumps every time.",1,94
"exactly what i needed: this was my first mp3 player, and i did a lot of research before i made the purchase. overall, i'm very pleased. instructions, while not very necessary, are clear enough, and downloading music has been a breeze. i haven't tried recording voices yet, and probably won't. the ear buds are inadequate, but i'm having a hard time finding any really good earphones, so i wasn't surprised. i am just now changing the battery (one aaa), and am very surprised that i've played as much music as i have on one little battery. controls are easy to use, the backlight stays on long enough to be of assistance, and the player works under gym conditions without a hitch. good price, good player.",1,125
"brilliant!: this wonderful book is a must read for all serious students of history. while it is admittedly beyond most undergraduates, it should be required for all aspiring professional academics in the humanities and social sciences.",1,36
very pleased!: for a beginner buyer i am impressed with the service. package on time and in mint condition as described.,1,21
"very talented band from iceland: i have been a fan of quarashi ever since they first were being played on the radio here in arizona, and their only aired song was ""stick em up"". every other song is just as good or better. i would highly recommend purchasing this record, it has its cool songs, it has its more agressive songs and all pieces come together perfectly to form a piece of art. i would highly recomend it anyone who either likes rap, rock or just the casual music listener, it has songs for any mood and feeling and greatly deserves my 5 stars.",1,104
the abandoned special insight into the secret life of a cat.: the abandoned should be required reading for anyone who owns a cat and anyone who has ever thought about owning a cat. this story is the adventure of a little boy who suddenly turns into a cat. a delightful way to obtain insight into the mysterious way cat's conduct their social life and why they do the things they do. i was given this book when i got my first cat. it helped me obtain a deeper understanding of my cat while enjoying a story that touched my heart,1,100
"another good release from therapy?: this is not therapy?'s return to form everyone has been calling it, for two reasons. first they've never released a bad album and second this one isn't better then the previous ones.this is a solid, rocking album, with great lyrics as usual, but i miss the experimentation and unusual approach of the last offers, in the end the main difference between high anxiety and suicide pact/shameless is that high anxiety is more radio friendly, and i think this is a let down.some songs are great, hey satan, stand in line and rust are typical therapy? and very good, if it kills me is a great song but my voodoo doll, last blast, watch you go and especially nobody here but us all seem to be not quite above the average rock playing on the radios nowadays.i think this is a good approach for new/curious fans but not the masterpiece us, therapy? diehard fans, been waiting for.the artwork is fine, but there are no printed lyrics.",1,170
"a pleasant surprise: i heard this cd at a friend's house and had to add it to my collection. i was never really a fan of tracy's work, but i was feeling this compilation of blues and folk tunes. the lyrics are poignant and are well matched with the arrangements. ""give me one reason"" is a standout as are the title track, ""the promise"" and ""i'm ready. "" i like the acoustics, guitar and strings on this cd. this cd made me a fan.",1,84
"the perfect gift for an expectant parent.: the outstanding quality of baby read-aloud basics is determined by the substantial research provided by the authors substantiating the value for reading to your baby, the organization of the recommendations for immediate location of needed topics and the book reviews that are sooo practical when it comes to selecting books to read at different ages.",1,62

"powerful, hypnotic, densely musical ..........unique.: i doubt that you have heard any music like this. it's dark and overpowering but has a musical quality that mesmerizes. i'm in a mood to listen to this only rarely, but then, it's perfect. this is one of those rare episodes of creativity that few bands manage. i can only hope that killing joke will continue to explore the fringes.",1,66
"great vampire flick. needs a dvd release asap!: salem's lot was probably one of the scariest movies that i've ever seen. then there was a sequel. sequel? i saw both films at a video store that my grandfather owns. a return to salem's lot was there. i practically wore out the tape because i watch it every chance i get. i practically wear it out because there is no dvd release. shame. this movie has some great moments. it may not be as scary as the original but the film does have its moments. if warner bros. is looking for a cult classic to put out on dvd then maybe they should get this film. if they do, please don't screw it up.",1,123
"some of the most beautiful music you'll ever hear: i was reading an interview with jim white somewhere, and he was asked who he'd like to collaborate with. he answered by saying something to the effect that there are only a handful of musicians out there who are totally in tune with the spirit; hitting the very essence of the soul or something along those lines. one of the ones he mentioned was anouar brahem. i got the cd, and to say i'm blown away would be an understatement. brahem comes from tunisia, which has seen the romans, the spaniards, the phoenicians, and god only knows what other cultures, sweep over their beautiful land on the mediterranean at the edge of the desert over the millenia. brahem conveys all that and more without uttering a single word.",1,137
"a very studley stanley: i've used stud finders before but this one surprised me with it ability to locate studs under my homes 1-1/2"" thick combination gypsum board/plaster walls (in the 1950's they called them lath-less plaster walls, consisting of 1/2"" gypsum board, covered with 1"" of hard-as-rock plaster). easily allows centering on wooden studs and as a bonus, helps you avoid those pesky electric wires apparently ran at random through the wall studs.",1,74

"when a god walked the earth: i stumbled across srv when i serendipitously tuned into the 1983 austin city limits concert featured on the first part of this video. suffice it to say that the earth moved. i bought double trouble's albums (yeah, back then they were vinyl) and talked about them to anyone who would listen. then i happened to catch the last austin c.l. appearance, as well. pure magic, and how happy stevie looked, what rapport he had with the audience. god, he was great. i tell my kids: there were three guitar gods: jimi hendrix, stevie ray vaughan, and eric clapton ... but the greatest of these was stevie ray. just bought and watched this video, and it brought all the amazement back. there was nothing stevie could not do with that guitar. i also hadn't realized how wonderful his voice was, too... husky and pleading and soulful. why, oh why, did he have to leave us so young? rip.",1,163
great quality: i bought this picture frame for my wife 2 years ago and it is still working great. the quality of the picture was the reason i bought it. it came with cool features and accessories. i definitively recommend it.,1,41
"the best in the series so far: ultimate x-men is finally hitting it's stride with this book. with all the exposition out of the way, we're finally down to some solid storytelling. bendis delivers, and the artwork is beautiful.i'd give it 5 stars, but the ""dvd style"" extras aren't too thrilling. if you prefer hardcovers like i do, buy it!",1,60
"one of my absolute favorite bands!: this band is awesome. i've followed them since they first started. unfortunately they seem to have disbanded. great horns, vocals, guitar, basically great musicians all around. this really is one of my favorite cds i own out of hundreds of cds. this band is so good that i would drive quite a distance just to see them play one more time, incredible performers. i've never had anyone listen to this cd and not like it.",1,81
"works well, no complaints: perfect mat for what i use it for. generally, it gets a little tricky with p90x workouts that require a wider stance, but other than that, provides the cushioning i need on a hardwood floor.",1,39
great musical toys for little hands: this set is great for younger children. i bought them for my 9 month old daughter and they were perfect for her little hands!,1,30
"fantastic!: i love the bone collector! it was and is an awesome movie and i love the score! the music is eery and makes my heart race because i love the movie!!!!!!!! but i think it should have some of hte songs from the movie, such as the ""don't give up"" played at the end.",1,55
the best yet: i have bought each dexter season from amazon because i can pre-order and my account keeps track of each order so i can reference the past. i believe its the best price and even if its not its worth the service and guarantee you get with them. i also loved this season the best...showing dexter as a bit more human and many surprises in between. fabulous ending leaving me anticipating next season.,1,75
"i remember ...: i remember watching robin & his merrymen back in the 50's on my parents small black & white console television.it was really exciting back then and i shortly after got my own hat that robin wore.remembering it now,it was made of leather,brown & green with a feather that was 14"" long.it would be worth a fortune by todays standards.watching it now you can see how non-realistic the inside of the castles were made but as a kid you could not find a more realistic place.the one thing i like is that robins' camp and all outside activities were all shot in the forest,maybe that is why i have always liked the woods.the complete series is here and i have watched it over and over and it holds a special place in my dvd library.",1,137
best book about housebeaking your dog. ever.: when we brought our irish terrier puppy home for the first time our friend said to get this book. it is simple and makes sense. if you follow their guidelines your dog will be housebroken in record time. the only accident our dog had since that time was 100 per cent our fault and not the dogs. i cannot recommend this book more highly. first time dog owner? get this book. i have since given copies to friends who are first time dog owners.,1,91
an excellent read ...: my nine-year old daughter loved this book. it is one that she enjoyed reading and read through it quickly. it is the one book this summer that grabbed her attention and held it to the end. i highly recommend this book.,1,45

"sydney life, 1960: set in the 1960s in a fictional department store in sydney, this delightful book is pitch perfect.the story focuses on the women working in ladies' cocktail frocks and in ladies' evening frocks sections of the store. the demarcation relates not only the class of customer, but also to the aussies (mrs williams, fay and miss baines, patty) in cocktail frocks and the very continental magda in evening frocks. enter lesley/lisa, a naive young thing doing a short stint during the holidays after completing her leaving certificate.we learn a little of their private lives and aspirations, and the attitudes of the time (especially how men and women relate to each other, and the education of women) are spot on.if you didn't live through this era, this book will make you feel as though you did. and for those of us who did live through it, it is a wonderful time capsule - but with the addition of sophisticated wit and humour. very good",1,165
"love these things: big sound for a little price. the various sized rubber ""gaskets"" assure they will stay in place and can affect the level of bass that you desire. i also like the fact that one earbud cord is way longer than the other so you can wrap it behind your neck. i highly recommend them.",1,57
"fast, good brew,: tasty brew in a coffee maker with design that takes less 'visual' space on the counter--especially if used in a corner. use your own thermos caraf or 'construction-worker' type thermos if you wish to savor your coffee throughout the day.in addition, the plastic parts' snug fit, well-balanced glass caraf, and 'sleek' design make this the perfect drip coffee maker--especially at this price.",1,65
"the best designed cooling stand.: it's a little small for the 15.4"" laptop but with a little positioning it works fine. you won't be disappointed, unless, you buy one of the other brands.",1,33

"<3 this one: another one of my favorites, at the beach by huy voun lee, introduces a handful of characters and shows how they actually resemble their meaning. with amazing paper collage illustrations and xiao ming and his mother, this one includes the characters for person, big, small, sky, water, mountain, and sand. it also includes the characters that opened my eyes wide and led to my first custom made chinese charm from jiayin designs that i still wear often around my neck--the characters for woman and child and how when they are put together--woman and child together--the character that results means good.if you want to read my reviews of 35 different kids books related to china, visit my 7.2.2012 on myoverthinking(dot)com",1,122
"even an american loves this book: this book was originally assigned to me for a canadian politics class, but i never got around to reading it until after i graduated. it's a solid book - it really portrays the leadership style of stephen harper in the context of an ever-contentious canadian political history. johnson does a superb job of displaying harper as a leader unrivaled in his vision for canada. for americans like myself, it's a great book to gain a better grasp on major canadian political issues such as regionalism, constitutional politics, and of course, quebec separatism, among others. go for it!",1,103
"waiting in vain: waiting in vain is truly an enchanting story channer masterfully concocts the ingredients of life - passion, love, deception, power, betrayal, sex - into a tasteful and powerful drama.the characters dance in the vibrancy of life and draw the reader deeply into their emotional world. it is a beautiful piece of literature that one cannot afford to miss.",1,61

highly recommended: i would definately recommend this dvd to anyone who is a jerry lee lewis fan. unique camera angles really make you appreciate just how good he is at the piano. i would recommend this to any music lover as well. just remember though that it isn't just anyone you're watching. you're watching a living legend doing what he does best.,1,62
"tribute towards an end of an era in american music:: the sardonic brain trust that comprised steely dan in this outing, explore with delicious irony and wit various ills and taboo associated with american societal organisation; moreover, in the decade that followed the one undeniable theme that comes from this album and its predecessor (aja) is that despite the inevitable innovation, production advances and marketing associated with the music industry, that those lyrics and music, which will stand the test of time comes from both individual musician and songwriters whose passion is to tell us a story or to evoke through music both pleasure and pain that has been either masked or embellished. something the popular music failed to accomplish in the eighties, thanks goodness these musician and lyricist saw fit to utilise, jazz, pop rock and words to suggest to the next generation of musician and songwriters that it is indeed about the music.",1,155
"put on the tea and enjoy: the man from texasby rebecca yorkreviewed by: pamela ackerson (author home of the braves trilogy)i have read this book before. it was excellent the first time and it was just as great the second time around. it is rare that i read a book again. what is even more odd is that it is a contemporary romance and i rarely read those types of books either. which goes to tell you that the man from texas is an awesome read. i loved it. i finished it in one day, temporarily being interrupted by the need to cook dinner and feed my family and then went back to reading the book. this is a book you will not want to put down. put on the tea and enjoy.",1,133

"emergency alarm!: it's very nice...but like others said...the alarm is not very loud.it's like a wrist watch alarm!i have a wood furnace, and when the electricity goes off it would heat up real fast.this is a good product to alarm me to close it down!",1,45
"purchased as a going away gift!!: i purchased this for a co-worker who was tranferring to another division and across the country. yes, she just got engaged and she could use this book to look fabulous in her wedding gown.",1,40
black and decker drill/driver is very handy tool to have: i have bought this and have been using the driver tool for about 2 months....so far it has been very helpful in my recent move and dissemble/assemble process.very powerfull handy tool to have and it will definetely ease your work if you want to assemble furniture with lot of screws.i will definetely recommend this product.,1,65
"nintendo ds lite- coral: i have really enjoyed the nintendo ds lite and all the games that are available for it. i have had a game boy advance and was pleased that i could use the games from it as well as the nintendo ds games. this is a product that is not just for kids or teens, it has a lot to offer adults also. this is the most fun i have had with a hand-held game system and would purchase another one given a choice. i thought about several systems and am glad that i went with this one. would recommend this product to anyone interested in games of this kind.",1,113
"reaffirm the giving the love you already have: i keep the copy of mary ellen's book, ""a christmas filled with miracles"", by my night stand and read a few stories each night. i find that i can only receive, at one time, a small amount of the overwhelming emotions these stories bring. i know that if one purchases the book and only reads one story they will have received more than they have payed for! the teacher comes when the student is ready..love and light to all",1,87
"possibilities: what this movie does is open your mind to the endless possibilties of the universe. it ""helps"" you break out of the rigid thinking we all adopt as we grow older. for those who rated this movie as bad, i can only say they were somehow offended by the thought that their way of thinking is wrong. this movie lets us all see ourselves in others -- not to judge or compare others to what we think it right but to simply observe and be open minded.",1,88
"good reading for those of you who like steamy novels: marly chance is a young writer who definitely knows how to write great steamy novels. oath of seduction is a fast read with no extraordinary plot, but it kept me hooked from the first page to the last!if you are like me, looking for a hot read with a bit more than just emotionless get-to-the-act characters, this book should be for you. the futuristic setting reminds me a bit of ""warrior's woman"" from johanna lindsey. if you liked this book and are up for a more risqué reading then do not hesitate further...and if you like strong woman with strong personality that keep men at bay with snappy retort, read the 2nd book of the series: oath of challenge (have a look on her website marlychance.com).",1,136
"greatly symbolic book: yes, the characters are impossibly extreme, butthey are not there to be 'real'. if it were 'real'it wouldn't be fiction. she said she is a romantic,and that the characters are 'what we should be'.just wanted to say that first.the symbols and ideas of the book however, arealmost impossibly real. honesty (the best policy)takes on a different tone in this book, self-honesty.the sex scenes are good, the speeches are long, theplot is easy to figure out 50 pages ahead of you, butyou don't know the end (unlike king/koontz/ect).",1,90
"an excellent book!: highway one was an incredible vietnam war story. it was well-written and couldn't have been much better. it isn't too tough a read, yet it is descriptive and keeps the reader involved. it is a definate must-read if you are at all interested in this type of book.",1,51
coby cx-cd241: the portable cd players has excellent sound and very good for the price. the only draw back is the addition of batteries that must be inserted to have it work with the power cord.,1,36
"an important book to read: this book is had a profound impact on me. this book contains much historical information concerning the rise of the third reich and the political, economic and spritual situation leading to its rise. in addition, lutzer gives us valuable insight into how the church reacted (and didn't react) to the sweeping political changes of nazi germany. highly recommended.",1,63
"two headed monster: ""h20"" is basically divided into a soul and a rock side.sidea contains all the hits plus the lean,stripped-down ""crime pays""and the rolicking doo-wop of ""open all night"".side two contains the rockier ""family man"",""italian girls"" and the catchy ""guessing games"" making this a worthy addition to theh&o's early 80's showcase.",1,52
review for robinson crusoe: i thought this book was good because the adventure in this book never stopped and it kept me into the book. i also like this book because it is too long but it isn't too short. this book may interest many book readers that like adventure and suspense.,1,52
"great dvd collection, good price/ you cant beat the pice!: i love the devil lady! i started out watching devil man and eventually moved on to devil lady. it starts out with the story over a model who becomes the devil lady. you see her transformation from quite reserved woman to the demon woman as the series progresses. i paid around $30 bucks for each dvd in the 6 dvd. i wish that i would have known that the price was going to be so cheap for the whole series. i say go for it, you have nothing to lose. this is a good story, it will captivate you and have you wondering what is going to happen next!",1,119

"my family history in a novel: this novel was written in 1889 and set in 1863 in a sicilian fishing village within walking distance of verga's native catania. my paternal great-grandparents spent their lives in a similar village on the northern coast of sicily. reading this novel brought back my grandmother's voice telling stories of the fishermen with variations on the proverbs, superstitions, catholicism and village gossip of verga. in verga's novel, ownership of the house is lost through payment of a debt to preserve the malavoglia's family honor. in my family, the two fishing boats were sold to protect the family honor from a false accusation. in the cambridge companion to the italian novel, verga is written about extensively in a chapter about realism. this book is a delightful validation of social history in post-unification sicily. these peasants were hard-workers whose family and religion gave meaning to their lives.",1,150
"creepy for us, great for babies: yes, i must admit that the first few times i watched singing babies and singing toddlers it really creeped me out. but this dvd isn't geared towards adults, it is geared towards toddlers and babies! my 14 month son loves this series. he will hit the tv and yell ""ba-ba"" for his babies. i would definitely recommend this.",1,64
"facinating: not fiction. this book is a presentation of information gleaned from interviews with women (and men) in the sex industry of los vegas. its not just about prostitution, and its not particularly salacious. it is an interesting clear eyed look at a socially shunned part of living. you're not going to learn how to pick up a hooker, but you might learn who she is, what she's like, and why she's there. it fleshes out a stereotype. (yeah, please ignore the pun...)",1,83
"classical barbra: i purchased this cd for my sister's birthday. when i checked with her to see if she enjoyed it, her response was ""i played it six times in a row on our way to the seashore"".i guess we both give it 5 stars.",1,45

"seems to work: i read on a forum that my 2004 vw new beetle convertible requires this kind of fluid for the power steering. i had noticed the steering popping a little (for lack of a better word), and when i found where to check, it was a bit low. ordered this, put it in up to just below max, and i can tell the steering is more responsive now and haven't heard the popping. so it seems good.it arrived with a dent, but who cares. it's not for beauty.",1,90
can't stop listening to it!: this album really truely rocks. it is something that i have wanted to hear on the radio for a long time. it is a refreshing break from the sameness of alternative music lately. other rock bands should try to learn something from the donnas.,1,49
"back to my future: this was a favorite album for me in high school. listening to it again now, it holds up for me musically and reminds me that i have been anti-war for most of my life. it's sad that many of these songs' lyrics don't need any changes to be totally up to date.",1,56
"what a wonderful book!: this book is written with such a passionate aim: to help god's children experience the fulness that his holy spirit has to offer. how to be filled with the holy spirit is written in a very balanced charismatic viewpoint. it reveals how to receive the holy spirit in a way that changes one's life and one's life for christ. this is one of the best books written on the subject. many authors, evangelists, and pastors just say ""god bless you"" and finish there. but aiden w. tozer goes beyond that. he tells you how you can receive the blessing. that's what makes mr. tozer an excellent author. being filled with the holy spirit is a continuous process and this book explains that wonderfully. the holy spirit is here on earth for all of us. he's here to give us power and comfort. all we have to do is receive him. in return, we'll be filled! buy this book! it will definitely get your spirit excited and on fire for jesus!",1,174
"love it: this product is hard to find on shelves in my area, on the rare occasion i or my mom would see it we would buy up like 3 bottles at a time. i have just started buying it on amazon instead. i love that it absorbs quickly and doesn't leave my hands greasy (i hate having greasy hands) but still leaves my hands feeling soft and moisturized. the scent is light and pleasant, similar to the scent of the other aveeno products. i'll also use it on my legs after shaving and on any other dry/itchy patches i might have on my skin and the oatmeal in it really does seem to help calm the itching.",1,118
"stand by this book: i would have thought that a novel this long could become tedious. admittedly, anyone who is not an eager reader will find it to be a difficult read. but do persist.whether you enjoy stephen king or not will not particuarly matter, as this novel is not king style at all. it offers a realism not usually featured in kings outrageous novels, a realism that makes you stop and think. itproduces character you will really love or really hate, and is overall a satisfying read. it might take take youa year to read, or in my case, a month. but eitehr way,when you get to the end, you won't regret it.",1,114
nice and warm!: i have used these before when i used to do farm work. i get them for my father every year at christmas and he loves them. he looks forward to getting them and shares some with my brothers and friends.,1,43
"great military scifi: i loved this book and most of the others in the series. good action, characters with depth and actions with consequences. from a writing perspective, i think the first 3 or 4 are the best. the last two have a derivitive feel and lost the edginess of the first few books.i really like the universe that david weber has put together here with the interplay of the technology. space combat has the feel of the age of sail only in 3d (well, as in most such books, really 2 1/2 d).",1,94
"best bit ever!!: as an electrician, i go through a lot of small-bore wood bits. i picked up a few of these in 5/8"", 3/4"" diameters and 7"" and 18"" lengths. they are, without a doubt, the best drill bits i've ever used. they truly eat nails without eating the bit, and they self feed great. the 7 inchers are great for cordless drills. never blow up a spade bit on a nail again! my only gripe? the material houses don't stock them! i plan to order a lot more through amazon.",1,92
"entertaining!: i watched this movie with my 4 year old granddaughter whoabsolutely loved it. beary, a little bear cub has been raised in a human household with a human brother who seems to be anything but loving towards beary. the country bears are beary'sidols and after feeling that he was not a part of his 'human' family he sets off to find his destiny and through his faith in them the country bears, who had dismantled as a group, are brought back together.this was a really cute movie, had some great music and dancing in it and was very upbeat. also had a splash of humor, nice touch! great for the family to enjoy together!",1,115

"simply gorgeous: one of the places that most inspired matisse was morocco, a country of huge contrasts, vivid colors and dramatic landscapes .i missed the landmark exhibition for which this book served as the catalog, but i purchased it after vacationing in morocco. matisse's view of the country emphasizes the colors of moroccan cities and landscapes -- intense orange-reds and azure bluesz. it is also informed and inspired by moroccan design, which combines mediterranean and islamic elements to beautiful effect.",1,80

"an incredibly funny movie!: mel brooks is amazing. those of you who are very ""politically correct"" may not enjoy this movie as much (there are a few scenes that wouldn't be filmed today) but there are some scenes that i just play, then rewind, then play again! - especially the beans scene. moviemaking at it's finest! (i also recommend spaceballs, another mel brooks classic)",1,64
very good!: i've had problems with my 3 year old son refusing to take vitamins no matter what flavour they were. a friend recommended to try this brand and it works! although i did not tell my son they are actually vitamins. i just play a game with him that three bears are running to his mouth to count his teeth (daily dose is 3). he even asks for more! will definetely continue buying them.,1,75
"good gloves: good gloves so far -- i've only had them for a week or two. i got them for household cleaning. the xl size has a little extra room for me, a 200+ lb. 6' man. decent protection from hot water (but if it's really hot you'll feel it), no bad smell, and i haven't found them to be too bulky or clumsy for anything i've done, which has mostly been thorough cleaning of the bathroom and kitchen.",1,79
the most helpful and well written resume/job hunt book ever!: this book was a real find for me. i was over qualified for most of the positions i was applying for but this book helped me get all my 'ducks in a row' and land the job of my dream!! thanks mr. montag. you're great!,1,55
"good wallberg: this is a good movie and it is continually amazing to me how well ""marky mark"" can act. i am really tired of seeing his naked body though because i suspect that the muscle is getting a bit blubbery.",1,41
i enjoyed the book very much and highly recommend it.: the novel was fantastic. it related to teenagers in every aspect. it was full of adventure and i couldn't put it down. any teenager who is tired of reading boring novels should read this.,1,44
"works fine: i used it couple of times for flour, sugar, even for coffee creamer... no problems at all. i hand washed it and dried it and it looks good. the metal could be a bit thicker, but it's not too bad. it might be a bit too small for people who bake in large amounts, but it works just fine if you need something for every day use that won't take too much space.",1,75
"hannah's baby sister: cute book! we bought it for a friend who was getting another little brother, instead of her wish for a sister. it's a cute book for easing that transition.",1,32

"john denver dvd: a songs best friend - john denver remembered is a collection of interviews with a lot of people who knew john and some clips of john. this is not a concert by john but a series of people who knew john (his ex wife, manager, etc) there is some of john's music in the background (and 4 of john's songs in another section (special effects) but this is mostly people talking about john. i saw this on pbs but at the time they were having pledge breaks. the dvd does not have any pledge breaks or commercels and you can play it whenever you want if you buy it. even pbs may trim this down to make it fit ther time slot and if they have pledge breaks they may have to trim it more to make room.",1,141
great!: i liked this cd. no wait.... loved it!heres is the best songs:16. what's your fantasy - ludacris f/ shawna (10/10)this is a great song. i love it. ludacris is bye far my fave rapper. 5. bad boy for life - p.diddy and the bad boy family (9.5/10) love the beat. cool song. 15.so fresh so clean - outkast(8/10) cool catchy song. gotta' love it.,1,65
"good, but not easy.: i have had my kodak z760 for a few months now and even though it is a great camera, it's not as easy to use as it might seem to be. you have to know a litte about photography to really get great results from it. i have a nikon 3100 and i found it to be a lot easier to use. you do have a thousand options to work with the z760, but it does require some basic knowledge about photography. it's not a ""beginner"" camera.one of the things i love about this camera is the battery life. i love my nikon but i hate its batteries life. the kodak z760 battery life is just wonderful. you don't have to recharge it every time you take pictures using the flash.the picture quality is great. overall, it's a great camera. you only have to dedicate a little bit of your time to really learn how it works; and perfect everything the camera has to offer you.",1,170
"take to the store or the restaurant: i have had four editions of this book and it is very concise guide to selecting wines. ratings identify best values (shaded stars) and johnson includes advice on when a specific vintage is ""a point"" (ready to drink). he is at his best with french wines and one chapter focuses exclusively on bordeaux. one fault: the review of california wines is not very comprehensive. the simple rating system of one to four stars is realistic and leaves room for your own judgment. i recommend this book.",1,93

pass it around: i have read this book many times already. it is such an encouragement to read. the bible verses and max's insight combine wonderfully together. it small enough to be carried around whenever you need a pick me up through out the day,1,45
"with a fond shudder of nostalgia, one remembers...: ...the nasty reptilian burn down the sinuses and back of the throat that came with snorting crystalmeth cut with strych, aspirin, baby-lax and lord knows what else back in those evil days not as many years ago as i wish... the same malicious synth-drive as chrome and six finger satellite at their most nefarious moments, and then lordamighty that voice. successfully replicates the experience of doing bad drugs with a revival minister suffering the pre-epileptic shoogaloos of amphetameanie-psychosis after several comprehensive ect sessions in the solitary ward at parchman farm in preparation for a public encounter with the chair. not even jeffrey lee pierce ever got this bad. if you get your jollies off by driving around in heavy traffic imagining running pedestrians down, this rates just beneath the stooges for the soundtrack to your sickheaded little fantasies. electricity!",1,147

"solid and adjustable: i'd say that this is well worth the money. the only draw-back is that it cannot rotate the camera in a circle at all. this is very much a 1-shot camera. it can tilt up and down and can even flip the camera on its side 90 degrees and hold it there.i do have an issue with mine ,as well where the part that connects to the camera has a wing nut that will not move like it should to make for easy connection to the camera. pretty annoying. not sure if all models are like this or just mine. am looking into it.",1,107
"fantastic feats: highly enjoyed the book, and think it is a shame it is out of print and only available on a used book basis. i am using this book in the capacity of an english teacher to show kids the purposes of sidebars, etc., in writing. the book is published in canada and does seem to have a small anti-usa bias, and i am also using it as a sample of objectivity vs subjectivity.",1,75
great item: the garmin beanbag is just great. you can take down and put it away when not in use. i think this item works alot better then the one that goes on the window. i recommend this to everyone.,1,40
"good/interestingly moody/hypnotic: it is a really nice mood record with interesting production. that lead singer has a nice voice, you kind of have to strain to hear the lyrics, but when you decipher them it's pretty worth it. money well spent.",1,41
"better than some reviews give it credit for: i have the seond edition of learning perl and find that this book is not only far more accessible, but covers things that are useful for beginners that learning perl does not. the dbi for instance.at the price this title is going for used it is a bargain.",1,56
"ah the games woman play: while i generally don't like to see women play games to win a man, pandora's character begins her games in a way that is engaging and entertaining. there does come a point at which you just want to say, oh give it up already.... but just as you say that, the heroine herself begins to question the game as well! great timing, witty dialogue",1,69
"a worthy record: as the child of polish holocaust survivors, i read sara's children with a great deal of personal interest. the author succeeds in faithfully recreating polish jewish life prior to world war ii, including the gap between tradition and the encroaching secular modernity of a changing world. we all know all too well the ensuing horrors nazi germany inflicted upon europe's jews. the mutual help the garfinkel siblings extended to one another, often risking their own lives, was essential and inspiring. if you read only one book about the holocaust, i heartily recommend sara's children, suzan hagstrom's well-crafted memorial record.",1,102
"no loss for words here!: ok, so he's suppressing alot of rage, but damn is this a good cd! i have not bought a rap album since public enemy's ""fear of a black planet"" in the very early 90's. this cd has restored some of my faith in rap music as a credible music form. he's not spewing out how rich he is or how many cars or women he has, instead he just goes off on, well, everything. but, eminem uses his rage to create some very witty, surprisingly intelligent and savage lyrics which will make you fall out of your seat (either from shock or from sheer laughter). a bit rough around the edges, true, but he pretty much offers a commentary on how things really are, which we need more of in a somewhat phony society. good stuff!",1,141
the clorinator works great - like new!: i hooked it up and it works just like a new one. good product at a lower price!,1,25
"it's a grate movie: i enjoy this movie very much, the actors are very good, it gets a little sad at the end of the movie, when the korean fighter comes to say how sorry he is about the other fighter brother, and offered himself as a brother to the other fighter.but all in all a very good movie.",1,59
"some people are jerks: i think that the jerk that wrote the review earlier about seinfeld needs to grow up and get a life. what is the purpose of bashing the show like that? if you don't like the show that is fine, but why write a review purely mocking the show when it really has nothing to do with the dvd set at all, but rather your own ignorance and stupidity? oh well, i suppose that you will evemtually grow up and move out of your parents basement and become some sort of vagrant on the streets. good luck!",1,100
"what can i say, it works: i, like many i think, thought well, for this low of a price even if it doesn't work, i'm not out much. however, turns out the thing works like a charm. the antenna is indeed a little flimsy but since i'm not planning on holding up my tv with it i guess it really doesn't matter. it currently sits behind my tv on the tv stand so it's out of the way of little hands. i played with orienting the antenna horizontally or vertically, but didn't see much of a difference.",1,97
"its an estimator: and a great one at that. i use this handy device when i am out surveying sites which calls for room measurement. many times our clients time is limited and the intellimeasure provides a quick and easy way to get the information i need. i have used a couple of ultrasonics in the past that have ended up in the trash, no accuracy or reliability. this one will be a keeper. it is definitely not a replacement for a tape measure but provides great accuracy at +/-.5% for estimating and that is what it is designed for.",1,100

"3-6 is cool: hey man, i read your review and i would have to agree with you on the wicked part. it seems that they don't know what to come up with now. for example, choices 2, it was good but not as good as thier other stuff like choices 1. it feels like they lost the feeling for music that they had before like ""when the smoke clears,"" that was a cool cd. hey, you know what happend to la chat, murder she spoke was a kick @ss cd.",1,90
awsome product: great disc the songs sound just like they came out yesterday and as a former songwriter and dj i can say that this is a very mixable disc and i highly recommend it. it is well worth the asking price.l.,1,42
"did you see harold vick ?: sonny rollins loves to put ""diddies"" in his tunes, and those humorous notes and melodies is a hallmark of sonny's playing style. did you see harold vick ? it's comical and has a groove that makes you want to dance. sonny has a lot of albums you can buy to listen to, buy this one for the "" groove"".harold vick is a tenor player out of chicago. i'm not sure what this title implies",1,80
"continued success: its pretty simple really - if you liked ""they're only chasing safety"" you'll like this. if not, you won't.as far as those new to underoath, its an edgier and artsier version of metalcore/hardcore/emocore in my opinion. basically this album just grooves back and forth amongst hardcore, wild and desparate. a great sound in my opinion, and most importantly it doesn't disappoint the vast majority of their established fan base.",1,71
"works well, after getting used to the band: the headset works well, after you get used to the odd headband, which sits in front of the ear pieces, and as such on normal headsets. you need to get comfortable with putting the band farther back on your head than you instinct may be... to keep if from falling forward.. but then it goes well.the only issues i have is the long chord, the cable wrap is just too heavy, so i took it off, and now i've got this ueber long cable to get tangled up in things. and the other issue has nothing to do with the headphones, but the fact that the laptop or computer doesn't always have the properly colored connectors, so always having to find the right plug to fit in the right socket for mic vs speakers is a pain.",1,145

lucy's favorite toy: we have had this kong for at least 3 years. this is my crazy border collie/shepherd's favorite toy. she carries it around in her mouth all the time. it's perfect for playing catch because it bounces all over and it's easy to throw. it is just now showing signs of age so i'm ordering another to make sure she will always have one. it's sorta heavy so i think a large dog would like it more than a smaller one.,1,83
"you will not be able to get these songs out of your head!: it's a hit. this is definitely unwritten laws best album yet. every song tells a story that you can relate to on some level and that's what makes it cool to listen to. yes it's catchy and accessible, and at the same time it's the heaviest album they've created so far (the drums and bass are very metal), and that's exactly why it's so rad. pick up this record you will be stoked.",1,86
"cracked soles a year ago after 5 years of wear and pt: i had these shoes since i was a sophomore (2006-2007) in high school. and i must say, they were worth the money at the time. they were very light, perfect for running and physical exercise because of the traction. i took them with me when i went to college, only for the soles to start cracking after 5 consecutive years of wear and tear on pavement and on turf. i enjoyed them very much, and decided to get them again soon for physical training.",1,96

"exam notes is the fastest!: i just bought this book and am quite impressed with it. to be honest...this is the quickest way to achieve cisco certification. i used the exam notes book for the ccna and passed with room to spare. i did buy the ""big"" sybex study guides which were way too boring, so in my honest opinion the exam notes is the way to go. this ccda exam notes is right to the point and there are no extra fillers. there are a few typos, but nothing out of the norm. i will be taking the ccda on august 16, and most of all i'm confident i will pass.",1,112
"beautiful watercolours by a great artist.: i'm a big prince charles fan and i also love watercolour painting. this is one of those books you leaf through on a quiet afternoon while listening to some soothing music and sipping a cup of english tea. the prince really has a feel for the delicate and ephemeral medium of watercolour, carrying on a long tradition of great english watercolourists. i'm sure charles's talent was lost on the crass and puerile tastes of a princess diana. long live bonnie prince charlie!",1,88
"this cd is simply wonderful!: it takes you places you've never been, and once you start lisening, every bit of stress just floats away. i've bought it twice, but have given it away to loved ones because it's so beautiful. i'm now about to buy it for the third time. bravo, beethoven!",1,52

"extremely helpful: i suggested this dvd to a friend who was very appreciative and had the following comments: ""this is a very helpful and unique rehabilitative dvd. the exercises are very easy to follow even without having prior experience with an exercise program. the stretching alleviates pain and allows for greater flexibility. an added benefit is that the combination of the narrarator's soothing voice, along with the stretching greatly reduces anxiety.""",1,71
"simply awesome!: this book is a great overview of the history and variety of travel trailers out on the road. great quality pictures of all types of trailers, trailer parks and vintage ads. finally, an un-biased history of the trailer, which tells the real story of how the airstream came into being. the inventor of the aluminum aircraft-style trailer finally gets his due (hint: wally byam didn't invent it, he just perfected it and marketed it better). also a great source of ideas for those lost souls who undertake a restoration of these beauties. americana never looked so beautiful and interesting.",1,101
"i rate it "" very good"": using this product with 2 handsets for about 3 years. this is not a ""mercedez-benz"" phone but certainly an acceptable, reliable product. one handset has developed a problematic dialing button, but you just press it a little harder (smile). handsets work better if they have fairly fresh batteries. range is good when battery is strong.",1,61

"best mp3 player: i was looking at some stores for an apple ipod a few weeks ago. i stumbled upon this 20 gigabyte one that caught my attention. it was only $299.99 which is only fifty bucks more than the ipod mini which only holds 1,000 songs. this ipod holds 5,000 songs and is a very good deal. sony's mini disc players are good too, but they just don't stand up to the ipod. the outside has a sleek white coating which looks high-tech. the back is metal but the only bad thing is when you put your fingerprints on it it sticks to the ipod which can be seen easily. you should buy a case if that happens. they have really nice see through cases that fit snuggly on it. i'm recommending this for any one who reads this but if you have children it's almost christmas time and they might be wanting to get this!",1,157
"difficulty posing: i ordered 4 of these. (one in each color) from hogwild toys. they were stocking stuffers for my 4 kids. however, after recieving them i couldnt help but open them up and tinker with them. i love magnetic toys.i was really disappointed in how hard they are to pose into different positions. the joints are really stiff and need a good bit of force and wiggling. also, 2 of the magnets (one in a foot of one and one in a hand of another) have been inserted backwards because they repell instead of attract. even so the hands will still stick together just at the sides instead.other than that, these toys are pretty cool. i added some pics of my play time with them on my filing cabinet as they were doing some acrobotic rock climbing, haha!update: the magnets have almost all fallen out of the feet and hands of these guys after one 10 minute play by my child. they seem to be only held in by a metalic sticker. hopefully i can glue these somehow.",1,179
"slapdash: i liked it, although like many of stephenson's books, the ending seemed to leave me with a ""huh> it's over already"" feeling - definitely a scattershot work, but pretty entertaining. at times i had trouble telling the different characters apart, but it had the ""psychedelic trip"" feeling of attending big state u - for those of us who did. it wanders around the different cliques and interactions with a slightly different twist (humourous) on them.",1,76
"better than i expected.: my boyfriend really wanted to see this series, and i didn't care to. i decided to watch the first episode, just to see what the hype (after it was cancelled) was all about. from the first episode, i was hooked.if you like mob dramas, such as boondock saints, sopranos, the godfather, you would most likely enjoy this.",1,61
"so hillariously funny, a must read: from the start i could not stop chuckling and sometimes rolling on the floor lmao if you know what i mean. how one man could endure all he faced and still have the fortitude to get through it all, is only told in this wonderfully light read. long book, so you need to commit to it. it is worth finishing, trust me.",1,68
"sanyo ecjn55f rice cooker: works well, but it does take some time and attempts to get the rice consistency that you prefer. the instructions indicate you should soak the rice for 30 minutes before cooking, however with my preferred rice (jasmine) i get better results without soaking. the keep warm function works great with no burning.",1,56

"revenge of the geeks: because of my limited knowledge of modern day space exploration, i did not know what to expect when i saw this film. after viewing it, i knew it wasn't just ""another space documentary"". it was deeper than that. it was in my words, a ""space age gangster flik"". i say this because the whole concept of pushing the envelope and successfully launching a privately funded space station under the radar of nasa & the government was just too smooth! plopping down huge amounts of cash , putting it all on the line for the sake of introducing space travel to the masses. all of this & doing so ""privately"" without government intervention... well that was the plan. what a concept!michael potter's vision was truly multidimensional. throughout the movie there was a consistent layer of ""techie & science"" but underneath the veil lies the real concept..space entrepreneurs, space geeks, conspiracy theorists, or just curious, all have a place enjoying this film & i recommend it for your viewing.",1,171

this is the greatest cd's ever made: this is yet one of the greatest cd's ever made in the history of music. usually most cd's have a few bad songs but this one doesn't. buy this one so you don't miss out on it.,1,44
"best buy - convenient & durable: i bought this 2 years ago when i had my first daughter. i used it in her stroller on cool days and could quickly install it on the jogger when going for a run at the beach (where it's usually windy and cooler during the fall). it's very easy to switch from/to any stroller (less than 1 minute). when we visited relatives in canada at xmas, i installed the bundleme on the infant car seat and it kept her warm during our trek from the airport to the parking spot. in san diego one fall day, when she went down a slide at the park that was still wet, she ended up wearing only a diaper but the bundleme kept her warm as we walked back home. never had to worry about losing a blanket on the road, or having enough blankets to keep baby warm, or whether her feet were sticking out of the blankets, lost a shoe/sock, etc. i am now using the same bundle me with my second child. i'd recommend it to anyone who spends lots of time outdoor taking walks, etc.",1,192

"for james bond/dirk pitt fans only.: if you're a fan of james bond and dirk pitt, you'll really like this book. the hero is sort of an amalgam of bond and pitt and indiana jones and several others. and he survives more ""certain death"" situations in one book that all the rest combined. yes, some of it (ok, a lot of it) is totally illogical. but if you can suspend about 95% of your disbelief, it's quite a fun read.those readers looking for a well-researched techno-thriller based on fact should pass on this one. they'll just be annoyed by all the impossible escapes and situations.so, if it's so illogical and unreal, why did i give it four stars?? because i read it when i was home with a miserable flu. and for a few hours, this book made me completely forget about how bad i felt. any book that can do that deserves four stars.",1,155
"solving the puzzle: laura stevens provides a much needed road map for parents seeking help for their children with adhd. by providing step-by-step instructions, sound nutritional knowledge, excellent examples, problem-specific narratives, and good, common sense day-to-day practices (i.e.-recipes), she is eliminating the frustration in the search for answers for current and future parents of children with adhd. this book provides the type of aid that only could have been given by someone who has had first hand experience in raising children with adhd. parents can now learn what to do directly from the book rather than waiting while much of the medical community is playing catch-up to scientific literature.",1,109
"the perfect mikado: well, i don't know if it is perfect or not. however, it does have bar numbers, which is more than can be said for most of the vocal editions out there. and they match the published full scores.when you are rehearsing or doing any type of serious work with the music, being able to reference bar numbers is invariable. ""second bar of third system on page #148"", just doesn't cut it.",1,74

"good watch - almost great: this watch is really good for the price. it's loaded with well-made features, but it has one major flaw that prevents it from being a great watch: the display. unlike the nice silver color of the digits as seen on the official picture, the numbers actually show up a dull bronze. this makes the watch very difficult to read without a direct light source or the backlight on.other than that here are some good points:-well designed interface-well builta few minor faults:-unit runs a little fast (gains about 30 seconds/month, i.e. gains about 1 second per day)-the design of the band/case is somewhat blandoverall conclusion: i recommend this watch.",1,113

"intense war-time mystery.....at times too intense: this is one of the best-written and most logically thought out mysteries i have ever read. mr. hyde has obviously done his homework, and knows exactly how to keep the suspense at a consistently high level throughout the book. i'm very tempted to buy another of his books, although i understand from the critics' reviews that this book is something of a change of pace for mr. hyde, and so i'm a little unsure about it. i would have given the book five stars, except for the items already mentioned in other reviews (a second autopsy on a body, the very detailed descriptions of what happens during a bombing raid), and the very intense description of the killer's home toward the end of the book - up until then i was reading each page very slowly, but i sped through this part - it really turned my stomach.but that aside, this one heckuva good read.",1,161
"rocked out trad irish ballads.: the blaggards manage to make even some of the sillier songs from the trad canon, such as drunken sailor & big strong man, sound cool. any band that can pull off singing 'the fields of athenry' to the music of 'folsom prison blues' has it together. when they bust into a reggae groove in the middle of covering elvis' 'suspicious minds' you wonder how far the tongue is in the cheek, but you can't argue with the singers long john silver voice and the flat out rockin' that goes on. the fiddlin' isn't half bad either. you can get this from cd baby.",1,108
leaked but was able to fix :): was a little frustrated at first because no matter what i tried it leaked right where the pipe from the wall and bracket meet. followed the instructions and didn't use pipe tape. it also says to hand tighten only. a quick call to waterpik customer service solved the problem. simply use bar soap and coat the threads of the bracket and pipe. i did use a wrench to gently tighten and no more leaks. :) also had a little trouble removing the orange water flow restrictor but needle nose pliers solved that problem and i was able to pull it out.,1,108
five! five! fiive!!: i have never read a book in a day until this one. i just couldn't put it down. i loved paranoia (another fast read) but company man was a little disappointing to me so i was skeptical of this book. killer instinct is a fast-paced thriller that readers will love.,1,53
a nice pick me up: this book is filled with quotations and sayings to help lift you up. when you are having a bad day its great to open this book and find a quote that applies to your situation. the sayings are positive and uplifting. something that can put a smile on your face. the book is small so you can carry it in your purse or bag.,1,69
"fantastic value for money: bought this re-conditioned on sale for $30. best $30 i've ever spent. if you need/want a 1/4 inch shaft bit router, you can't beat this for the money. i have used it in a router table also and it works remarkably well there, as long as you are mindful of the 1/4 inch bit limitation. i think it regularly sells for $60, and quite frankly, i would not be unhappy with it at that price either. you're not going to build major furniture with this, but if you want to be able to do most other things that a 1/4 inch shaft router will do, this is an excellent buy!",1,114
i think this book is a wonderful book for children to read!: i think this book is great! i recently read it for my college children's literature class. i think she did a great job of developing the characters and really made you feel like you were living in their shoes. i think it is very educational for children to learn about what african americans went through in the south during that time period! i'm very glad she won the newbery award in 1977. she deserved it!!!!!,1,87

"russo novels seldom disappoint: the rogues, tricksters, mentally-ill, gamblers, alcoholics and ne'er-do-wells in risk pool are nothing less than adorable. russo writes beautiful prose that pulls at every one of the reader's emotions. here, he creates a cast of loafers with a dry humor that will have you laughing out loud at times. i've read six of russo's novels and while this one wasn't my favorite, it's nonetheless a masterpiece. it starts to run out of gas in the last quarter of the book but by the end it's... kinda worth it.",1,92
"where you find it entertaing: i did read other reviews but found i had to check it out for myself. yes the heroine jennifer was a little controlling...i am woman i can do it all on my own, and part of me admired her for it. however mick was the man. he didn't let her dictate the movement of the relationship. okay she broke it off but i somehow had faith my mick would wear her down, boy did he. the other charcters were wonderful support in the story. her little girl who drew them together and her best friend telling gf how it is. love when a gf honestly tells the other one they are stuck on stupid, it just tickles me. well the book satifised this romantic reader, and i'm very pleased i purchased this book.",1,138

"the duchess of bloomsbury street lives on today..serendipity: a fabulous ending to over 20 years of letter writing. penpals of sorts. a must read for anyone, but writers it can tear down any writers block you could possibly have. she is so articulate and real. i highly suggest this book!",1,50
"fabulous: i read this book for the first time in sixth grade for a book report. it soon became one of the few books that would burn in my memory for a long time. it took two hours of reading a day to finish in time for the book report, but it was well worth it.",1,56
"power!: the best product i have bought for my camera. it makes my xti look like a large pro camera. and i love the ability to turn the camera 90 degrees and shoot.i have lots of battery life. i mean lots! the camera sits in my case ready to go for days and i never have to worry about running out of batteries or recharging. i charge it once a month, and i am good to go.i also like the aa battery insert, instead of the rechargeable, i could go into any store and buy aa batteries and be ready to go.i had no problem securing the grip to my camera. i was just careful to install it the first time. i will never take it off!",1,127
"greene's greatest?: to start with, i am a greene fanatic, so you might take my opinion with a grain of salt. i didn't read the end of the affair for many years after i'd read virtually all of greene's other novels. i love his thrillers, his adventures, his ""serious"" works. but i didn't think i'd love a book about an adulterous affair, particularly one with god and catholicism at its center. i finally got around to it. how wrong, wrong, wrong i was.having read it twice, i now have to ask whether it's greene's best book. every aspect of the book is unexpected: the reason their affair ends, why she leaves, who the man she's seeing is, bendrix's response, all the way to the end where bendrix befriends her husband.what in other hands would have been a simple morality play, is so much more thrilling. an absolute masterpiece, unlike anything else written by gg (or anyone else).",1,157
"about ten years ahead of their time: this album blew me away so hard when it came out--more innovative and original than anything at the time. omd did have their own quirky vocal flavor, which may explain their limited popularity. personally, i loved this album then and i still do. these guys were simply genius. i'm listening to this album as i write this. it's the first time i've heard it in more than ten years. it still strikes as intelligent and honest, with a waterfall of soul and emotion coming through compelling electronic sounds.",1,95
"the best of mel brooks!!!!: ""oh de camptown ladies sing dis song..."" i loooove this film. some of the greatest comedians working with one of the twentieth centuries greatest directors. mel brooks turned what would have probably been quite a dreary script (originally called tex x) into a work of pure comedic genius. there is something quite subversive about this film that he never quite managed before or since.cleavon little as sheriff bart is right on the button, especially in his initial reaction to the townsfolks bigotry (""oh, lordylord!!! he means it!!!! do what he say!!!!!!""). gene wilder is at his absolute peak never missing a laugh and even getting some quite unexpected giggles from some rather mundane lines. harvey korman, madeline kahn, slim pickens... in fact the casting is so right that this is one of the most faultless spoofs ever made!!!!!!""...do dah, do dah.""",1,146

"the most beautiful thermodynamics book ever written: this textbook was passed onto me by my previous supervisor.i have always been looking for a thermo book that is exactly like that. every concept is self-contained, and presented formally (mathematically and verbally) and succinctly. more impotantly, with this book i can teach these concepts myself, and can be referred to *quickly* in the future. it is both a beautiful textbook, and a handy reference book.historically, the evolution of human understanding on the subject of heat and thermodynamics was best described as ""a big mess"". this book finally brought (almost) absolute order.indeed, it is sad to see that this book is not really in print, and is very expensive (new). i am very fortunate to have my hand on it.",1,127
works great with racechrono and my old nokia: i bought this gps receiver to work with the racechrono software and i am not disappointed. the gps is very easy to use and tracking is precise enough for my application. i can analyse my laps and see if i am consistent and where i could gain few seconds. it is even accurate enough to analyse trajectories.,1,65

"xitel inport deluxe- easy to use !: connecting the cables was so easy i was sure i must have missed something.recording the music is equally easy. removing the snap crackle and pop was a snap. my only confusion resulted in recording from 45rpms, i should have left them as stereo because it seems as though if you check off as mono, you can not remove the crackle and pop.",1,69
"great slicer: it is very sturdy and the blades are sharp. i used to have an all-metal one (not oxo), but it would bend when i pushed down on it. the oxo slices through the apple quickly and easily, and the rubber grips are easy on the hands.",1,48

"wow, couldn't stop reading this novel. . . . . .: try reading this one on the beach! you will get the shivers too. i loved the whole story line about sam, the orphan who is taken in by the old sailer, darian. you too will try and figure out the connection between them and the other characters they encounter. the suspense about the other rememberers fates was gripping. i love the way the story ties into atlantis, the greek gods and the state of the current world as it relates to the lost world of atlantis.",1,97

"you wanna know joe!: joe's third album may be his most succesful and i might be going a bit overboard, but i think it's his best. i wanna know, the song currently heating up the charts has brought a lot of attention to this man. it is well deserved and if you love that song like i do then you will probally love this cd.even though i have liked him for a while i think r. kelly overshadowed him a bit(just an observation). but this cd seperates them by far now. joe even colleberates with n'sync, and not being a big fan of them, i kinda like this song.the standout's are: i wanna know, treat her like a lady, one life stand, and the remix to thank god i found you.i think joe has another classic on his hands and i am happy to see him having even more success. if you like r&b and keith swaet and r. kelly then you'll like this work, maybe even better. to all you current joe fans go ahead and pick this cd up, it is another steller piece of work.",1,188

"very good, very personal: golders green, a northern jewish suburb, is where badfinger used to live, a place where ham could record his little songs on a revox tape. some of the songs the guy wrote are amazing. he was defiently one of the best songwriters to come out of britain. his material on badfinger's ""straight up"" and ""wish you were here"" are 100% superb. perfect pop songs. ""golders green"" is a really good album, it shows ham's songwrting and performance talents. ""dawn"" is a beutiful psych ballad,""makes me feel so good"" could have been easily 'the first power pop anthem' if was released at that time. the rest is quite the same, very mccartney in total, similar to mcca's early solo albums, sometimes even better.",1,126

"strange bedfellows: ted nugent and steve farmer had to be one of the strangest combos in rock history, and it still amazes me how well they sounded together. nugent's early guitar work was distinctive, fluid and original, more refined than much of his later stuff. farmer's songwriting antics were just as original, although his attempts at psychedelic ""deepness"" were sometimes hilarious. (and he hasn't changed much, check out his ""journey to the darkside..."")nugent claims he didn't know the songs were about drugs... does anyone believe that for a minute?this disc is missing some notable songs, including ""surrender to your kings"" and ""inside the outside"". also, for no good reason, this version of ""prodigal man"" has been remixed, with instrumental passages out of their original order. who would do such a thing?but this music is definitely worth hearing... the amboy dukes showed way more imagination and talent than your average 60's american garage band.",1,153
"the best cd of the year!!!!!: what can i say? this is the best work earth wind & fire has done in years. i'm most excited about two songs: 1)""lovely people"" (you can't help, but, just get up and dance to it); and 2) ""pure gold"" (maurice's voice sounds so sweet and rich) i highly recommend that you buy it. you won't be disappointed.",1,64

"""shouting to the sky"": i have been an ""oils"" fan since 1988, and believe it or not ""diesel and dust"" is one of my least favorite songs. however, the album, ""blue sky mining"" is by far one of the best!! every song is excellent and evokes a passionate response from the listener. the arranging of the music is perfect, which is sometimes hard to imagine with the amount of lyrics peter garret tries to ""fit"" into a melody. from the working mans songs :blue sky mine, and king of the mountain to the smoky, mountains of burma,and rythmic antarctica, you are transported through every range of emotion and can find common threads no matter where you are from; i'm a canadian. and once you've heard ""stars of warburton"".. the ""oils"" will have you ""shouting to the skies again""....enjoy!!!!",1,138
very special..till the end: i absolutely love this series...its amazing...but honestly the end was a let down...it was rushed and what evr happens 2 tally and david? definitely reccomend this book...only if ur ready 4 a let down ending,1,39
world subways: really enjoyed the good overview of the subways of the world. learned a lot but not too technical or detailed. it would be nice to see perhaps an expanded version (but not too detailed) of the book and subways covered. also more photographs (those presented are good) to help characterize the uniqueness of each system.,1,57

"far out!: what a little gem, and at a bargain price!! originally released in 1970, at the dawn of the ""progressive rock"" era, this instrumental recording is short on the pomposity that marred alot of stuff from that time, but is high on whimsy and laid-back, otherworldly atmosphere. lots of cheesy organ and fuzz-box guitar, along with tribal drumming. i'm gonna have to play this one on halloween night - it'll be perfect.",1,73

"another classic by the masters of trip-hop: it is said that imitation is the best form of flattery. if this is true, the fact that several years after its release, the opening ""angel"" continues to appear on original soundtracks should speak volumes. from the first chord, the third album by the band that brought trip-hop to us along with portishead and morcheeba is yet another classic. at several points, it feels like a precedent to some of the chillout acts to come in later years (remember this was released in 1998). with a tight bass sound streaming from song to song, a sexy beat and a hypnotic keyboard frame to it all, this album lacks nothing, and raises the bar above their previous 'protection' where the main thing i miss is the participation of everything but the girl's vocalist, tracy horn. think no more and get it!",1,147

"scary: this mask is very realistic. i really don't know how masks are made but, looking at the way it is painted leads me to believe that it was done by hand and by a professional. i scared the crap out of my kids the other night. they got me back the next day (he, he, he...). anyway, the mask fits fine. it's a little hard to put it on and take it off because it is narrow around the neck area. i don't think i could walk around with it on halloween night for long though; that is because it is hard to breathe with it and because i couldn't see very well either. nevertheless, the mask is very well made and realistic looking. if you're looking for something scary, you can't go wrong with this mask. (four stars because of the breathing problem)",1,145
"still great: i've seen this twice in theaters. the first time i couldn't stop focusing on the beautiful animation. the second time i wanted to see it with my friend. everyone i talk to about this movie loves it but what's not to love. it's funny , got some action , and is pretty dramatic in scenes. the pickles and eggs joke is so funny so suspend belief and see this movie. you won't be sorry. who cares if it flopped? my friends and i sure don't.",1,87

"a shock to the system: well, i just read other reviews on this book - and my initial response is, why read a book that obviously isn't your cup of tea? yes it is gory but that's this particular reader's preference. sure it is ugly and i read to be shocked. and i was. i found it took me a little while to get into this book, hence my decision to give it 4 stars. however, once the author had grabbed my attention, she had it - i couldn't put the damn thing down! halfway through, a major plot change happened and left me thinking ""what the heck?"" and i couldn't wait to finish it. i loved this book. i gave it to a friend of mine - and she too has the same opinion. if you want background and thorough reasoning to why killers kill - keep with true crime, if you want a great fast-paced interesting fiction story about killing, then this is it. i can't wait to read another of this author's works.",1,176
"okay for the price: this is a good product for it's price-range. it is rugged and compact. however there are some annoying quirks which could have been avoided. e.g. no backlight, having to cycle through fm1/fm2/am1/am2 in order to go to a preset, a lock button that's difficult to use.",1,50
"man o' mannheim!: i love christmas music done in ways different from the original, and this album is a great addition to the library of anybody of like mind. it is still refreshing, even though recorded in the early '90s. in other words, there is a good reason it is still being produced.",1,53

"impressive prose style of budding new novelist: i have already read the reviews of four distinguished asian hands: messrs wade, bufton, barnes, and hamilton so there is nothing more historically i can add that has not already been said by them.i was very favourably impressed by the prose style of ms morris wu. it reminded me a little of marcel proust's ""a la recherche du temps perdu"". she likes to dwell on images and incidents for pages at a time. in her case she can command the reader's attention throughout. it takes a particular talent to do that and i think it is a remarkable achievement especially as it is ms morris wu's first novel.i would like therefore to recommend this book for anyone interested in taiwan history with four stars****as i want to encourage the author to continue writing, bearing in mind the comments and improvements recommended by the afore-mentioned reviewers.",1,152

"quicker picker upper: these cards are perched on the way to the front door.whenever i have a few moments, i pause to pick a card.i enjoy the tidbit to take with me through my day.my personal set was given to me as a gift.i bought these as a gift for a friend.i will likely buy more.",1,56
good product - works well: product works great. a little more plastic than i would prefer but the resulted weight helps with ease of use. price was a bit high.,1,30
"perfect for everyone except the tech-geek: i understand what others are saying about the sound quality, but we just turned up the volume alittle on our tv and found no difference. if you are buying this just to enjoy the movies than this is the product for you. if you have a home theater and want the best of the best and always comment on the clarity, sound, etc... than wait for the deluxe edition, but for the majority of us who just want the watch the movie it is perfect. also, they are the full length of the movie.",1,100
"aliens, cops & danger: first, the cover design rocks. i was one of the people who thought this was a paranormal romance, but it's more of a science fiction mystery. it's a darker story about an alien hunter, mia, who has to work with a dangerously attractive -- and plain dangerous -- alien because her partner will die if she doesn't. it's one of those who-do-you-trust? stories and i liked it a lot once i got into it. i was reminded of the politics of non-humans vs. humans in charlaine harris's novels.",1,92
a must have book!: my father had cancer and my mother had alzheimer's and this book was so helpful in dealing with both of their illnesses. it is short and simple and gives great advise mixed in with the author's own experiences. i would highly recommend this book for anyone dealing with a serious illness in a loved one!,1,59
"a very unique perspective: this book was not what i had expected it too be when i started out. it was written from the perspective of death, during a very dark part of the world's history . . . the holocaust.very well written, very moving.it proves that some people know the right things to do . . .even if they are on the wrong side. they knowgoodness and compassion.very well written. i highly suggest reading this moving story.",1,78
"great second solo album by ozzy: any metal head will agree-diary of a madman is a great heavy metal album..captures the great guitars of rhodes, on songs such as-- over the mountain &flying high again..wow!what a follow up to their debut ""blizzard of ozz""..",1,44
"gift: this was an anniversary gift. the giftees are very happy with the it. i does a great job of cooking large meals both on top of the stove or in the oven, just be aware that these dutch ovens are very heavy.",1,43
"if you like george romero this is a must-own.: george romero's name goes a long way with undead/zombie fans.this movie is not part of the other films, but it is a step out of time, but it still has biting social commentary (pardon the pun.) the acting is not great, but it's a fun story, if your style of fun is watching zombies killing everybody they can.",1,67
"no bs: i am surprised more people have not reviewed this book, as mcdonald provides readers with a comprehensive, in-depth guide to designing a diet suited to ones needs. women especially would benefit from this book, as they tend to place severe restrictions on their diet, only for their days of starvation to backfire as they tumble on an out of control a binge-a-thon. getting a fit body does not require such a miserable lifestyle; mcdonald will not do the work for your nor tell you crazy rules and food combinations. what he does is give readers the tools to utilize a highly effective, non-retarded diet. it is only up to the reader to actually follow through rather than merely reading the material.",1,123
"it was tight, but not as tight as am i my brothers keeper: this cd was pretty tight. it had some tight ass beats, with some interesting lyrics. i suggest you go get this. the beats sound different and that's what makes em tight.",1,44
"keep them coming!: hooray! i was wondering about the 4th season; it's good to know they're still coming. i'll buy every single season. i think i'll throw up if i read about someone complaining about the packaging on this one--who cares! as long as the dvds are being released, don't complain!",1,51
"useful purchase: looks sturdy and comfortable, a little bit bulkier that expected. did not have chance to use it in public though - we just started potty training.",1,28
"especially for fans of brick and wes anderson: fantastic movie.if you're a fan of brick, you'll probably be a fan of whatever this director does. so this movie is for you.if you're a wes anderson fan, you'll love this movie, because it seems to take its inspiration from many of the same things anderson takes inspiration from. it's like one of his movies, done by someone else.",1,67
"guide to machine quilting: after reading most of the book, i find it very educational and interesting. always like the tidbits as they are helpful.",1,25
nice package!: ha. not much to say. new balance is to foot as jockey is to package!it's the only thing the men in my life wear!!! fathers and sons and hubbies!,1,31
"dewalt 735 planer: i have only used this a couple of times as of yet,i first ran some really rough oak through it,next was some walnut and i am really impressed with how well it planes in both instances. i really can't tell any real difference between the quality of cut using the slower( more cuts per min.) speed rather than the faster one. really like this machine!perhaps even more stars are to be rewarded for their prompt customer service. the unit arrived with a broken gear case cover. going to their web site gave me the part number and a short email explaning the damage in transit resulted in receiving the replacement in just a few days. there may just be a place for some other yellow tools in my shop as a result.i have read of problems with the blades wearing too fast, and i guess time will only tell there.",1,153
"power pop is back!: if you're looking for a great cd to purchase, look no futher! this cd is new and refreshing from begining to end. nothing too complicated here, just great music. i could honestly tell you that i do not have a favorite track on the cd because they all are great. give me the posies straight up with a twist of r.e.m., great tunes with great harmonies. also, a great cd to pick up is ""homesick"" by this same great band. i am fortunate to live in the same area as these guys because they are great live as well. what more do you need to hear? buy the cd's and check them out!",1,117
"wow! if you haven't read this book, read it now!: i loved this book!it was written as a real 13 year old would write!i mean, it sounded like it could be my diary!i never got bored reading this book, and i read it at least 6 times!",1,47
"you can't just sit on a pedestal: having just enjoyed the excellent film kitchen stories, i am inordinately pleased for two reasons.first was the film itself; i can't remember a movie i've ever seen that was told in such a deadpan manner, yet had such a good heart at its core. the inherent humor in the scenario of one man observing another is explored, not exploited, in an intelligent and witty fashion. i particularly enjoyed the fact that whole scenes would pass with no dialogue at all. also noteworthy was the cinematography, which gave everything a handsome nordic sheen.my second source of enjoyment were the reviews posted herein; it's rare to see so many good reviews so unanimous in their praise of a work, whether book, cd, or movie. i will safely assume that kitchen stories attracts viewers of only the highest caliber.",1,143
"a must read book: this is by far my favorite emily book, although i love all of them. i think it is the funniest one, and overall just told in a great way. i love all of lmm's books and series, but i just wish she would have written more about emily--i was dying to read more about her!!! (*sniff sniff*) this one ended in a suspenseful sort of way, with the reader wondering what teddy's feelings were for emily....that makes one want to read the next book soon, which is good! also, i think that the chapter where emily is locked in the church was really nice....it was sweet....i also wish someone made of movie of this!! i would love to be emily!! lol lol they made movies for anne which were really good, so why not emily???",1,139
"great dog house: hi, we purchased the xl for our 85 lb rottie and she loves it, and she has plenty of room. i filled it with cedar shavings and she was quickly napping in it. i would definitely recommend this dog house.",1,43
older but valuable: used this book as a refresher in order to teach a basic electronics class. the thing i like about this version is the great amount of detail the author goes into on the subject matter. another instructor here told me that his later versions tended to be lighter on the detail.,1,54
"nevermind the cliches, this is an incredible record: im sure anyone who has gotten this far has heard the anecdote about everyone who has bought a vu record started a band. the fact of the matter is, even if you buy a record because it is influential, you wont listen to it unless it is good. this album is better than good. every song here sounds like it could have been written in the last 10 years. even the more avant-garde tracks, once played to annoy club owners, sound good by todays standards. this is a classic and an absolute must have.",1,102
"a book that reflects the true nature of russia: most people outside russia perceive it as a slavic, christian nation. that is a wrong way of looking at it. russia is a symbiosis of slavic/christian and turkic/muslim elements. david l. ransel's fascinating book reflects this dual nature of russia and gives an insight into its complex inner soul. a wealth of details and astute observations make this book a pleasure to read.most recent books about russia concentrate on its urban aspects or on its general political or economic aspects. unlike them, village mothers presents a picture of its rural life. russia has been a largely rural, agricultural country for many centuries. its industrialization started only a few decade ago. that's why it is important to understand the village life in russia. david ransel's book helps to do just that.",1,139
"kmtcpp: i dont really agree with many of the opinions above. jaco had worse days than others, and every jaco fan knows that, but to label this disc as one of his ""bad ones"" is absolutely wrong. if you've heard the ""stuttgart aria"" sessions then you'll know what his worse days were like. compared to weather report days, this album is far from good, but nowhere near his bad days. this is a fine piece of work and one of the best in the n.y series, with an outstanding 17' teen town!!!! a must buy in my opinion.",1,98
"nice twist of jellyfish: the real reason i bought this was because of the collaboration ringo did with jellyfish and (very little) brian wilson. for the bargain bin price i paid for a used cd, the purchase was well worth it. nothing on here that you will ever hear on the radio, but it is right up my alley, and i do recommend it to any fan of the beatles, jellyfish, elo, etc. i would rate it a solid b.",1,80
"tom verlaine's ""cover"" is close to perfection: i was bewildered a few years back to find out that this incredible solo album from television's tom verlaine was not available on cd. although i could still cue up my original vinyl lp to enjoy verlaine's superlative songwriting and his majestic guitar work on this album, i took the time to digitize the record and burn my own cd. this is an album that i wanted to be able to enjoy at home or on the road. ""lindi-lu"" and ""five miles of you"" are two of the best songs that verlaine has ever recorded, but there's not a bad song on the whole collection! and his vocals have never been stronger. if you like verlaine, if you like television--hell, if you like the electric guitar--you should own this album!",1,137
"pretty good: it's actually a pretty good documentary, and phil collins does a good job. not a lot of it is really new, but it is pretty good, and the clip of you can't do that is pretty spectacular. i'd suggest this to a beatles fan.",1,46
"these things work!: i am a serious walker. i have walked 10 miles virtually every day, except sundays, for over eight years. i figure that i have walked over 25,000 miles during this time. i am 68 years old. an article about exercise and longevity at the new england journal of medicine got me started on such an endeavor. plantar fascitis (heel pain) has bothered me quite a bit lately. so much so, that i have been contemplating cutting back on my walking. today, i received my order of these heel protectors. i put one on my left heel and i received immediate pain relief. i will keep you posted on how they work over longer term.",1,117
"recon scout: great wwii account of front line warfare: recon scout by fred salter is an excellent read! this is a first hand account by an individual that is a self-proclaimed ""maverick"" in his approach to life. he served in wwii as a scout for invasion forces in north africa and europe. his first-hand experiences are captured here from the perspective of the guy in the trenches, not from the perspective of a professional novel writer. he shares both the experiences, and emotions, of battle and the hardships associated with living on the battlefield in a life and death situation for extended times. a 'must read' for anyone interested in the history of warfare in general, and wwii in particular.",1,120
"wow i love this shower bar!: we first saw the arc shower bar while we were traveling this summer in various hotels. so we decided to get one for our shower at home. these are great shower bars. with the arc the shower curtain stays in the tub and the tub is much more roomy than with the traditional shower bar.i highly recommend this product. it is easy to install, works great, looks great and is good value for money-what more could you ask for?",1,85
"points worth keeping in mind...: fox provides refreshing advice that everyone should keep in mind. althought the points aren't really specific to being a ceo, they're tidbits of good advice on the most important adventure of all, life. a book that's not only worth the money, but definitely worth the time.",1,51
pool supplies: glad to get my supplies for next year. i'm keeping my pool clean next summer by being prepared. came on time.,1,23
"good, could have been great: i have to agree with mis_led from mich. - see if you can pick it up on discount. i loved seeing the show again, but the price was high for only 8 eps. works out to about almost $6.00 (u.s.) per episode. i was not able to find the ""hidden messages to leapers"" promised on the box. also, there is a pocket for a booklet, much like the box sets of babylon 5, but there is no booklet.the episodes them selves were fun to watch. you can see how things changed between season 1 and 2. it was funny to hear ziggy refered to as ""he"" when in later seasons ziggy has a female voice.the box is nice, loved the vortex look. hope the keep that for future season.over all, while i found it a bit lacking in the bonus', and expensive on a per ep cost, am glad i picked it up and look forward to the next set.",1,165
great looking weights: i like these weights! the material is such that you get a good grip even if you tend to sweat in the palms like i do. these are great looking too. happy i got them!,1,38
unbelievably awesome: i like that the dwarves respect bilbo now that he has helped them when they were in trouble. i also like how they get caught a lot.,1,29
"brother labeling good as always: i am quite pleased with the tz231 1/2"" tape. i prefer the 1/2 over the 3/8"" tape because it is easier to read as folder labels.",1,31
very entertaining murder: i learned of brendan dubois when he was a contesrtant on jeopary. i findn his style of mystery writing very entertaining. i read murder mysteries all of the time. i am glad to have found him.,1,39
great product but...: this product is great. only issue is that it isn't vista compatible out of the box it takes some major digging on microsoft's site to get the fingerprint reader to work,1,34
"6515 case, it's okay for the money: the case is and does exactly what it is suppose to. it is not the hightest quality leather when compared to some of my other cases for other ppc's and phones. overall it is a good case quality workmanship and sized right.",1,49
"fast, beautiful read: having seen the movie first, i did find it hard to make myself continue reading into the last half of the book (knowing what was coming). however, it was a surprisingly fast read, a beautiful story that was definitely honored by the film.",1,46
"superior to drinkwater in some respects...: this middle volume of the william kite series is actually the first of the trilogy that i have read, but i am compelled to read the rest. this narrative is quite different than your run-of-the-mill sea fiction in that it treats a civilian's perspective of the war at sea and charts the development of the protagonist from isolated merchant skipper to a driven privateersman. it is particularly noteworthy in two respects--kite is very much a real person and does not suffer from an incredible/implausible list of infallibly heroic traits--kite sees the american ""patriots"" in a strikingly de-mystifying way.the book's style is influenced by victorian writers in general. i sniffed a particularly strong dose of dickens, which is, of course, a good thing. highly recommended for those interested in a meaty read before the fireplace.",1,140
"pretty good cover: this is not a flimsy vinyl plastic cover nor is it leather-like coverage - its in-between and just right. it fits my classic road bike very well and provides coverage all the way down to the ground almost even though i have a tall 27 inch frame. i'm not too enamoured about leaving my bike outside, as i am concerned about accelerating its rusting. we'll see how this works out. otherwise, this cover is a good value for the money, fits properly and will keep away the bad weather. perhaps a fully zippered breathe-able fabric cover might be the best? i have not seen one. lacking that, this one is a very good one and definitely worth the $20.",1,122
summary: published by bruno gmunder oversized. the next in a long line of fantastic black and white photo books by bruno gmunder featuring fresh-faced college-age guys. a nice addition to your coffeetable-book collection.,1,33

best value speakers: the installation is very easy and the speakers sounded great. i used them to replace some rear surround in wall speakers that deteriorated over time.,1,28

"a must have!: immersive storyline accompanied by excellent animation...i see butterflies already, watch the movies and you will understand!",1,19
what a great storie!: from the first page you are sucked into this adventure! when maddie bursts into john danhill's room and announces that he better not tell the two men chasing her that she is there. she then goes on to tell him that she got in his room because she told the clerk that she was his wife. from that point on you can't put the book down. it is a book with wonderful characters and good dialog between the characters. maddie is quite a spitfire and he admires that about her. i also enjoyed the friendship between john and boone. i would have given this more than 5 stars. it is a keeper on my shelf. i highly recommend it!! you won't be disappointed.,1,127
pizza tiger: if you are in the pizza business or if you are thinking about getting into the pizza business - you must read this book.easy to read - but a bit slow in parts - the nature of biography in my opinion .. so overall subject matter for me was excellent and i am in the pizza business.on a literary scale the book was only a 2 star - but 5 star for me as i used some of the ideas and confirmed some concepts.daddio,1,86
"an amazing performance: mr. glass has put his incredible talent to work in this project. his enthusiastic discussion of the evolution of drumming styles while he actually plays them for you is riveting. i recently saw him in person demonstrating some of the highlights of this dvd, and he was captivating, funny, talented, and a joy to see. this dvd is a must-see for any music lover.",1,67
great collection: this is a great collection of the last 4 movies in the nightmare on elm street franchise. you'd pay double the price trying to buy these movies individually and they'd take up more space. get this collection. you won't be disappointed.,1,43
"love this album: i love this album and all of his other albums. plain and simple. since you can preview the songs, just take a listen. his guitar playing so very underrated. he rocks.",1,34
"junior did a fine job!: i understand that this cd encompasses more musical styles than previous junior brown cds, but that's the joy of listening to junior. he is musically diverse, inventive, original, and hugely talented. nobody does texas honky-tonk music this well these days. and as for the rest of the songs, nobody even comes close. this is actually my favorite junior brown cd, and yes, i have seen him live as well. if you truly are a music lover and can appreciate innovation and different types and styles of music, then you shouldn't have any problem with this cd. junior's love for the same is apparent.",1,108
"accessible and fun, the big six perfects the new swing sound: along with big bad voodoo daddy and royal crown revue, the big six deserves it's place among other new swing bands. the all-star lineup provides jump swing with an addictive rock-n-roll bill haley & the comets backbeat that'll get you out on the dance floor. a must-have. if you ain't moving during 'lady of nagoya', check your pulse....",1,69
this film is one of the all time horror classics!: my review consists of just a few words if you havent seen this movie you might think its old but to think that this acually happened and to put yourself in those teens shoes is terrifing enough for even the most hardcore horror fan!!!!,1,54
first time parent !: my baby loves to be here he can move by him self and do what ever he wants here love this product !!!,1,27
"the best books made. ever.: i've read what most people call classics. the tolkien series. 2001: a space oddessy, along with the stories that followed. but, dan simmons's hyperion, along with the following fall of hyperion, endymion, and the rise of endymion, blow every other book away. from the start of hyperion to the end of the rise of endymion, this series will not let you stop reading. these books are magnificent.",1,72
"excellent trip: i really like this and i am not a fan of rogers. don't expect great songs here, the title track might be the only real song here and its the weakest on the album - but it is a commerical overture that seems to achieve the goal of leading to the close of the album. clearly meant to be heard start to finish, i like the trip, and music moves well, the sax and clapton's sparse guitar rifs fill in the beauty of the picture being painted here. reading the other reviews i realize the story that plays in my head may not be exactly what its supposed to be! oh well! i like the roadtrip the album takes me on.",1,123
"healthcare kit: great for your baby...used the nail clippers and they worked great for nails, especially the little lens. haven't used the other items yet but probably will when my baby gets sick.",1,33
a well made hit!: this was the costume my little one wanted one halloween. i was happy to find one in the right size on amazon. i was surprised at how sturdy it was. no falling apart mid-way through trick-or-treat. the only problem was trying to get it off of my son at the end of the day. he wanted to sleep in it. then he wanted to wear it the next day too!,1,74
great simple story: i love this book and it's my favorite present for boys or girls from 2 to 5 years old. it's a great simple story that will make your child smile and think. and i guarantee that you will also enjoy and learn from winnie's experience.,1,48
the body: i really loved this movie. i found it to be compelling and not too far from the mark when it comes to religious fevor by certain religious sects. i may be a christian but i believe by faith not a body or certain doctrines.,1,46
"excellent suggestions: i am an interior decorator, and this book has wonderful suggestions for the beginner and seasoned pro. i abosolutely loved the ideas, and i recommend this book to anyone who is interested in decorating!",1,36
this works!!!!: we bought this bear for our daughter when she was about one month old because she would not sleep in her crib for more than an hour at a time. as soon as we turned it on she started to doze off. she is now 4 months old and we still use it. she loves it and looks for it before she goes to bed. the down side is that you will go through a ton of batteries but its worth it for her to get a good nights sleep (and us too!).,1,95
"one of the greatest stupid movies ever created: i love this movie and i don't have words to explain how great it really is. if think you have a sense of humor and a little bit of sarcasm, you must see this.",1,42
"holdin' it down for the bay: keyshia obviously represent the great talent we've got here hiding in the bay area. i love her vocals; she's got soul, range and a voice that'll just blow you out of the water. the most popular song on this album seems to be love, which, i must agree with the most of you, she kills the chours with that up and down range thing. she does sing live lovely. like, you didn't know it was a real talent as oppose to synthicizing. she holds a note better than beyonce can. i look forward to hearing more from here because she is an awsome talent.",1,110
"what a gem of a book!: most of the reviewers here have covered the beauty, passion, tragedy and romance that transcend time in autumn bridge. i liked it even better than cloud of sparrows. it's literarily and spriritually more expansive. matsuoka takes literary risks with the mysticism. but it works. i first purchased the audio version. listening to it prompted my purchase of the hardcover. reading it in print is a little different experience. even deeper. recommend both experiences to get the richness out of it.frankly, i'm surprised that this book didn't launch matsuoka into superstar status. it's that good.",1,100

"a life saver on the plane!: i bought this for my yearly home trip cross pacific ocean.unlike those pricey noise-cancelling earphone, this just reduce the outside noise by blocking.it's a much better choice for audiophile on plane since you don't have to suffer from the audio distortion from noise-cancelling.all you need is a nice in-ear phone and put the muff on.you can enjoy the music with least distortion and distraction.also you don't have to boost the volume up, so you are actually protecting you ear which noise-cancelling cannot do the same.most importantly, it cut off those unpleasant noise as well.in my west-coast to east coast flight, it save me from screaming baby and impatient mother.thanks for this muff, i'm the only one can still be myself in the whole plane~~it's a little bit hot after wearing them for hours, but it's nothing compare to the tranquil it brings you all the way.",1,152
"excellent parody on hood films: the wayans have done it again. keenan screaming ""message"" in certain parts of the film was too funny. a lot of what was spoofed will keep you laughing. there is this one scene that marlon wayans is in that will have you laughing so hard, you will have to pause the dvd so you can recover. i've seen this movie about 100 times, and still laugh at that one scene like i've seen it for the first time.it's a funny film indeed.",1,87
"keeps you turning the page... who is roarke.: recommended by a book reader on another site, interesting story line and plot, set in the future with all the electronic gizmos and gadgets. keeps you turning the page, trying to figure out who roarke is. tidbits of eve dallas coming out slowly, parts of the story slowing down to a crawl then picking up again. i wanted to read the last three pages half way through the story but didn't. enjoyable and worth the time to read it... love eve dallas attitude.. not impressed with the wealthy folks she has to come into contact with. loved her excitement over a real cup of coffee. as for roarke... secrets to be uncovered.",1,120
"great watch,-- great dealer!: i had looked at this watch in regular retail stores. i thought i would check out amazon's pricing and availability.fantastic results! it was half the price and recieved the watch in two days!

"quick read world news: i purchased the economist as a supplement to more expensive financial investment news services online. i had read special editions purchased at news stand prices, and found it almost too much to read in a week. the regular weekly edition is well organized, with capsule summaries of events up front, and longer feature articles on the same subjects further back.the british and european news and political bias is different than what we get on cnbc, investors business daily, and usa today. many of the writers are very good, but the usual lack of credibility stands out in some others.",1,103
"a very good magazine...: this magazine is very good for all coin collectors. some of my favrorite things about the magazine are the articles. the topics can range from sleepers to major shows to legal issues. the topics are diverse and interesting. the magazine will keep you up-to-date with the hobby!another good feature is the price guide. with each issue there is a price guide containing the retail price of many us coins. they also have graphs showing the price performance of collector coins (vf coins) and investor coins (ms-65 coins). this will show you trends in the hobby.the only thing i do not like is the advertisements. some, not all, of the companies have bad reputations for over grading there coins. other than that, this magazine is the best monthly coin magazine out there, and i would highly reccommed it to any fellow coin collector!",1,146
"classic short story collection of the greatest detective ever: to say it's sherlock holmes would be enough except for this 20 word limit imposed by amazon :-). if you're a lover of classic mystery stories, as i am, this book will be a delight. the collection contains stories as chronicled by sherlock holmes' able bodied assistant james watson, the mysteries are always intriguing to holmes and unique in such a way that they pose some form of deductive challenge for the world's best deductive reasoner. once you begin to read you will be taken back to old england in a time where the world was just beginning to use science as a means of development rather than warfare and chivalry was still alive and kicking, this book is a must read for all you book lovers!!",1,136
"great for those that want to experiment.: i just bought myself a zojirushi bread machine, so i bought this book to go with it based on the overwhelming positive reviews. the recipes in this book seem quite amazing and surprising at the same time. i never knew you could make bread with so many different kinds of ingredients. while i haven't tried very many recipes yet, i have booked marked all the ones i want to make in the near future. i only give it four stars instead of 5 stars because it takes a week to get the book ready to ship, so even with prime, you are waiting a good week and a half to get your book.",1,120
great book!!: my boys love to listen to these stories. i grew up on a farm and you can tell these are real life experiences.,1,25

"the best bachatero in dr: this is the best cd of frank reyes. if you are looking for the best bachata cd, you should buy this album. it was release in 1998",1,32
"good read: the book was very informative though appeared padded by newspaper accounts of terrorist activities which made the book longer than it really needed to be. excellent historical background which linked the past with the present, providing a how and why of our present circumstances.",1,46
book.: i dont like to review books because i rarely purchase books for pleasure. however the book did make it to me so good job.,1,25
"an incredible travel back in time.: this book will enable the historian, econamist, or anybody interested of our beginnings in capitalism, to better understand how america was built, and above all this very powerful man: john d. rockefeller sr.. the book is very well writen with a very easy flow of text, in short you will be reading mr. chernow's book and would not notice that a couple of hours has past.",1,72
magnificent is an appropriate title: barry harris has never followed fashion and has long carried a torch for bud powell this album demonstrates that he is unique to himself and that quality defies fashion. it is superb bop piano with the right mixture of old and new charts.the consistently excellent ron carter and the lesser known leroy williams contribute well to a very enjoyable session. highly recommended.,1,67
"funniest thing i've ever read!: i received this book a few weeks ago and finished it within two days. i came to find that it is the most hilarious book i have ever read. being a fan of maddox since discovering his website a couple of years ago, i was eager to read the book he was releasing, so when i was finally able to buy the book and read it i was happy enough. the hilarity inside those pages is the icing on the cake! definitely a 5 star book. give this man an award!",1,96
"a book i have read and re-read for 13+ years: i first read ""zen flesh, zen bones"" 13 years ago, and the stories within the ""101 zen stories"" section have been with me throughout the years! no matter what religion you are, no matter what age, these stories will change your life, and the way you respond to and see the world around you. you'll chuckle, you'll frown, and you'll wish there were 1001 zen stories to read instead of only 101... i hope you'll read this book and enjoy it as much as i do! i'm willing to bet you'll keep it on the nearest bookshelf, and open it often :}",1,112
breathtaking...: this album blew me away. the songs are simple and the singing is heartfelt. the vocal harmonies are perfection! i can't say enough good things about this album.,1,29
"30 day shred without the dread!: i bought jillian michaels' 30 day shred a few years ago, and i still use it to this day. maybe not consecutively, as it is probably supposed to be used for, but it still works. when i first bought it, i wasn't avid on exercising, since then i am much more fit but i still pop it in the dvd on those days when i don't have much time for a good workout.the content within the dvd is great, i love jillian - she's the best drill sergeant you can ask for. the workout are relatively simple to follow but pack a punch if done correctly and efficiently.overall a good purchase for those beginning to workout or those in need of a good and brisk workout.",1,132
how fat creates oppression and stereotypes: fat people are widely represented in popular culture as being revolting: as agents of disgust yet kathleen lebesco argues in revolting bodies?: the struggle to redefine fat identity that fatness is more than a health or aesthetic issue: it is also a political issue. revolting bodies? informatively and thoughtfully considers sites of struggle over the cultural meaning of fatness and will have a special appeal to college-level health students as well as the health and fitness community with respect to its analysis of how fat creates oppression and stereotypes.,1,95

"a must buy for all: a fab cd from a long time ago...now in the present they are better than ever!! remember ""fire on high?"" well, no ""best hits"" cd's even carry it...so drag out your vinyl and reverse the garbled audio in the beginning there is a message....that was free.. even in the old days of san francisco with the late great radio station ""ksan""..they didn't even know it realize the message. but this cd is ""fantastic""..better than you would/can imagine..filled with great jeff lynne guitar and sounds...a must..grammy contender...miss you john! jeff lynne keeps his idol john lennon's memory intact with probably visions and audio signals from beyond, honoring john's missed opportunities, in this wonderful cd...!! e",1,119
great tape: great color choices and price. planet bike always has great products that dont break the bank. i rap all my bikes with their tape.,1,26
"overall strong arrows, but it could be more accurate: some arrows when shot get thrown completley off-target. another bad point is that since the points are crimped-on, if you hit a solid hard object by accident they will force themselves inward and splinter the wood a bit. but as far as spine strength goes, they are very strong. one of them accidently hit concrete, but didn't get damaged.",1,68
"good & fast: the movie was great and it came fast,it was easy to track and i can see myself buying more things on amazon",1,25
back to nature: we've been using this keeper for several months and are delighted with it. it's a little pricey but we like it. it works perfectly for our 2 person household. mark it down $20 and get a 5 star rating for value.,1,44
"phenomenal look into the darkness: i love mlvf as an author, first of all. her work is so concise and to the point, and absolutely eye-opening at all times. she not only sees really clearly, but is especially skilled at helping other people to. this book is one of my favorites that i have read by her. the other one is the one about dreams and death. this book is an exceptionally good look at how evil and the shadow operate and are expressed by the psyche. also, whether or not you're into fairy tales, this book is still a great resource, in terms of psychology, creativity, mythology and cultural expression.",1,111
"save time and money: i have been struggling with skincare products and beauty products all my life. skin is much more complicated than ""oily"" or ""dry"". in reading the skin type solution, i was able to find my specific skin type (ospw...oily, sensitive, pigmented, wrinkle). now i know exactly what to buy for my skin. what's also helpful is dr baumann's website, drbaumann.com, she continues her service by having a forum for readers to share information and a q & a section where you may even receive an answer from her personally! i think the book is a great investment and the website is a terrific supplement.",1,107
"curved shower curtain: love my curved shower rod. i saw these is hotels and thought what a great idea. with my small bathroom and the fact that i hated my sliding glass doors, this has made a big differance in my shower experiance. so much more room and so easy to pull back the curtain and clean. the rod is very nice and my husband had it installed in no time. wished i had done it a long time ago.",1,80

good show history: i have watched the show since 1956. it was fun to read about the show over the years.,1,21
"bite sized morsels: john piper is my favorite contemporary christian author, so it was no surprise to me that this would be another engaging, worship inspiring work from him. his longer works such as ""the pleasures of god"" are amazing when you have a bigger stretch of time for devotion, but this provides a perfect alternative when a larger work might put one off from even getting started. each meditation is a bit longer than a given entry from say ""my utmost for his highest"" (quite possibly the quintessential daily devotional book), but still easily manageable in a single sitting.",1,100
"great pc based card and software for price: i really like the product and it seems like they keep improving the software which is already very robust. i am using it with qsee cameras from a security dvr package i no longer use. i'm sure there are nicer products, but i was impressed given the price point.",1,57
"beware!! not black but works great otherwise: great product, good size, good price, fast shipping... wrong color!!! (white). it works so i just don't care enough to return it.",1,29
"introducing women's 'vows' in bengal: this book takes on the complex role of vows made by women throughout the indian subcontinent, but focusing on bengal. the author explains simply and clearly the phenomenon of the vow and its significance and empowerment of women and goddesses in hinduism. the stories behind the vows are fascinating and worth reading the book just to learn about them. what i liked about _making virtuous daughters and wives_is that it easily understood by those who have had little or even no background in the scholarship of hinduism or women and religion.",1,96
"the planets aligned: there will probably never be another production with this much magic involved. the time was the berlin wall coming down, the place was berlin. the crowd numbered in the tens of thousands. luck and god was on their side to pull this off in so little time. amazing!!! there could not have been a better celebration of such a historical event in time.",1,66
life in hollywood can really change someones life.: i enjoyed reading this interesting book by evelyn waugh. she did an excellent job on the words that she used describing the characters and their moods. at first it was sort of difficult for me to understand but then i started to catch up on what was going on.all of the characters in which waugh created did an excellent job of making this novel start to smooth out and make it easier to understand.in my opinion hollywood is a place where there are a lot of movie stars and tourists who go visit there and have a good time.i never heard of it being like some haunted place that many terrible things happen there such as many great people dying.i would recommend this novel to many other people out there who enjoy the type of plot that evelyn waugh had set it to be.i myself enjoyed it and i was thrilled to have a chance to write a report on this novel.,1,170
"hori fs3 is big great quality for low price: this was product was really worth it compared to other generic sticks i have had in the past. though there is a square gate, it shouldn't be problem after u play with it for a while, but if it really bothers you then changing out the gate is pretty simple. this stick has upped my game way more than i ever thought. this stick>dpad in my opinion.also for those who ask if this work for pc's, it does as many of my acquaintances have bought this as well, and this stick mostly plug and play on vista 32 bits and on one window 7 32 bit operating system.well, in my opinion this stick is truly a great stick for bargain hunters. and better buy quick the stick went up in price pretty quick(about 12 dollars more) in 5 days.",1,148
it's a power chord.: i bought a power supply for gaming computer on new egg. i didn't notice it didn't come with power supply (something about using the old one and going green). they don't sell single power cables so i came here and bam! it's a chord. it works. problems solved. compatible with any pc or monitor.,1,58
"makes expressing quick and easy!: i'm a seasoned breastfeeding mom with now 4 children under my belt. i've tried pumps in the past (at least 2) and never had much luck so i've expressed milk by hand. this worked fine but seemed time consuming and my hands got tired. after reading many online reviews of different manual pumps i finally bought this one.i'm very impressed! on the first use i pumped 3 ounces in barely 3 minutes! the letdown feature worked nicely and once i had letdown the milk flowed into the bottle. its compact and very quiet which i love because if i'm out noone needs know i am pumping. taking it apart for cleaning is simply and quickoverall, i'm tickled pink that i took the plunge again and am extremely satisfied with this purchase. i would recommend this pump to anyone who had an established milk supply and limited time to pump.",1,154

"solid cd not quite great: this is a solid cd from ufo. my favorites are sea of faith, out law man, quicksilver rider, and serenity. schenker doesn't solo much in it but i don't always think that is necessary if doesn't fit the song per se.he uses slideguitar in outlaw man and kepps things tight",1,55

"before there was conan, there was kull...: for robert e. howard neophytes, a little background. reh created kull prior to conan, but had difficulty seling his stories. what few there are were sometimes far more involved and intricately plotted than the typical conan tale. since they didn't sell, reh came up with conan and a few of kull's tale actully were transformed into conan stories.one of those was ""by this axe i rule,"" which was loosely adapted to become ""the phoenix on the sword,"" as i recall. some people actually prefer the character of kull to conan. regardless, kull is a worthwhile and enjoyable read.",1,105
"all-time classic: the halloween series are one of my favorite franchises and this started it all,i read that the 25th anniversary version looks funny compared to the laser disc version but divimax did a great job to me.",1,38

"excellent overview, not for novices: a great overview of current care standards and practices. also includes some personal narratives. directed to professionals in the health and therapeutic fields, but clear and readable by non-professionals, including patients, family and friends. probably more useful if reader already has some familiarity with the field.",1,51
his best yet!!!!: john edward is an amazing and inspiring person. i've read all of his books and seen his t.v. show. i consider myself a devoted fan. this was his best book yet. his writing style is easy to read and he seems to make what he does sound so simple and easy for him. he has changed my perspective on life and the after life. he's trully gifted and makes me happy whenever i read his books. his insights have helped me and my family in many ways. get ready to shed some tears with this one!,1,99
"princess dora claims victory.: this is a cute story about dora solving a problem for her friend, boots. dors earns rewards along her journey until she is able to use the rewards to save boots. very cute!",1,37
"more o'malley excitement: stephen o'malley is a paramedic who has had enough of being a big city emt. in a promise to his dying sister, jennifer, he says he will leave the big city to take care of heart attacks and sprains in the slower pace of the country. on his way out of chicago, he receives a call from meghan, a childhood friend, who is looking for a little comfort from the rainstorm and a ride to her parents' house.the story of stephen and meghan's early relationship is told brilliantly in flashbacks. when the story catches up to present day, the plot twists and turns like a scenic mountain road, blending stephen and meghan's lives with a series of jewel thefts. this is by far the most tantalizing o'malley mystery. stephen's struggle with the concept of having a relationship with god adds spiritual depth to the novel.the other o'malley novels are: the negotiator, the guardian, the truth seeker, the protector, the healer, the rescuer. each is a wonderful read!",1,170
"great album: destiny's child have really improved themselves over the year after their debut album that didn't really succeed came their 2nd album ""writing's on the wall"" who's a smashing sucess and now came their 3rd album who's also great in ""survivor you can find many upbeat songs one of my faves there are:bootylicious,nasty girl and happy face and there are also slow songds there my faves are""dangerously in love who's an excellent ballad beyonce really did a great job on writing this amazing ballad.my cd contains another 2 songs who aren't on the us version:dance with me and my heart beats this cd is really reccomnded go destiny's child",1,110

"the big country restored/preserved & in blu-ray format: at the film's conclusion, the follwing message appears: ""the big country (1958) restored by the academy film archive with funding provided by the film foundation and the academy of motion pictures arts and sciences."" however, no additional information regarding the restoration process is provided. a ranking academy member acknowledged several years ago that the big country received a non-digital, ""completely photochemical"" restoration for its 2008 50th anniversary debut {credit: lincoln spector/bayflicksdotnet}. perhaps it is safe to assume that the restoration credit on the blu-ray and the 2008 restoration are mostly one in the same. regardless, this blu-ray format presentation of the big country is a pleasure to view and i will not fault this technirama gem-of-a-film. the transfer is very good. (this wal-mart exclusive can be purchased for less than $10 at the wal-mart company website)",1,144
"shouldn't be missed: tender, heartwrenching, and very romantic, this film is amazing, and will give a better understanding of cuba and its people.this tragic love affair, set against the politics of repression is a story one won't forget...made vivid by the magnificent black and white cinematography and a marvelous soundtrack.the acting by everyone is superb, and the two leads, mayte vilan and rene lavan, utterly gorgeous. miguel guitierrez is so moving in the beautifully written part of the father.this is truly a wonderful film, and makes me so appreciative of the freedom i live in.",1,95
"good lens for what i want (not change the lens): as you can read in other reviews, it does suffer from pincushion and vignetting so did my old 18-55mm so nothing changed there. i like this lens because of the nice range 18 to 135mm, i was considering the 55-200mm but i don't see myself changing lenses most of the time. i recommend it.",1,64
"working well: i have not used any sophisticated measurements to verify that these cables are any better or worse than any other cable. however, linking a yamaha ysp-3050bl digital sound projector to a samsung 46"" lcd they fully met my expectations providing clear and clean hidef images from bluray, dvd, and directtv. this is the lowest data transmission connection and this cable has fulfilled the need very well. i hate giving 5 stars to something that does what it is supposed to do but that is an unfairness of rating systems.",1,91
"great book, but needs a companion: wheelock's latin is clear, well-organized, and brief. there's only a few pictures and not much talk about roman history, but for those of us who are serious about wanting to learn ancient latin, their absence is not sorely missed.since the chapters are short (about 5-7 pages in most cases) the book is ideal for self-study. i would add, however, that whether studying in school or on your own, but especially this latter, the addition of a companion guide will prove to be invaluable.for this, i recommend grote's comprehensive guide to wheelock's latin -- a book that offers a little more repetition, fuller grammatical explanations, and is written in a calm, reassuring style. (another plus is that it, unlike others, has its answer key printed in the back of the book -- so you don't have to wait a few months for your answer sheet if you get one at all.)",1,156
"alice ...: alice, as always, has outdone herself presenting us with this beautiful evocative album. one could listen to it for hours on end.",1,24
"presumptuous but it works: i found the idea of an american male attempting to write a companion novel to mrs. dalloway, in the style of virginia woolf, quite presumptuous. needless to say i was extremely sceptical. after reading the hours, i must say it was beautifully executed. although this is not a sequel of a classic and does stand alone, anyone wanting to read this should read mrs. dalloway first to appreciate all the nuances and subtle referrences. any fan of mrs. dalloway (my favorite woolf novel) should read this... you surely won't regret it.",1,95
"pole: i bought this maybe 2mnths ago and it is awesome. its just as great as all off the other expensive poles that are out there. i way about 150lbs and it supports all of my spins, turns, invert, just everything!!!! i'm really glad i bought this it stays in place very well. it has not fallen or moved since i have installed it. my friends come over and we all enjoy getting on it and best thing about it is that it supports your weight",1,86
"definitely one for the collection: i first heard of anna nalick when she appeared on the today show. i usually don't like the quality of the concerts performed on this show but i stopped in my tracks when i heard anna performing. i immediately ordered her cd from amazon and don't regret it a bit.the writing on the cd is amazing. the lyrics are as original as say, gavin degraw's. she conveys and evokes exactly what one would feel if they were in the song's situation beautifully without incorporating cheesy cliches often found in ""down and out, love gone wrong"" songs.the song i most identify with is satellite. i think the lyrics to this song are brilliant.some have mentioned that the lyrics on most of the album are depressing. well, yeah. don't artists write what they are feeling at times? i know in my cd collection i have a variety of music because i have a variety of emotions. i am happy that this one is at the top of the list when i am a bit melancholy. you will be too.",1,182
"castles and cold white legs: trying to vididly recall late childhood is a nearyl impossisble task - let alone getting the mood and emotions down in print. royal blue does it wonderfully.the main charatcter is in turns the wandering, homeless waif and then, convincingly, the object of desire.a must read for anyone who enjoys an honest, sharply observing voice.",1,59
"a monster of a book.: rambling, discursive, entertaining informative and highly individual. with particular reference to eastern europe and orthodoxy. norman is a eastern european specialist and so balances up the usual highly western european, catholic/protestant bias found in histories of this sort.",1,43
wonderful reading: this is a wonderful book that it is better if you read it little by little so that you can meditate on it. this is the second i buy because the first one i lent it to a friend and never saw it back. it is the kind of book you can read again and again.,1,58
"a must have for every animorph lovers collection.: if you are looking for exitement, laughs, and thrills, this is the book for you. even though it is not as good as other books in the series such as the invasion or the alien, it is still a must have for every animorph lover. the cover may be a bit wierd-looking, but it is a great book.",1,66
lovin it: i purchased this cd because i heard track 15 which is act iii the confrontation between t.i. & t.i.p. it appears to be one of those cd's that i play when i am traveling or in my f it mood. i am not the least bit disappointed. i put this cd in the player and i play it from track 1 right through to the end of the 2 bonus tracks and i hit repeat to start it all over again. my faves are:#9 help is coming#6 watch what you say#19 the hottest#7 hurt#18 my typehighly - highly recommended!,1,101

"good, but not quite 5 stars: if you've seen the movie, forget all about it while you read this book. nothings the same except a couple character names and one or two scenes. this is one of the better vampire books around, altho the psychological aspects didn't come through as much as they did in armor (a 5 star book which every sci-fi fan should read). the little references to armor (felix & jack crow, the antwar bar) are cute but actually detracted from it for me",1,87
"enjoyable read: i read this a while ago and enjoyed it immensely. it's a story about women who are adjusting to having or not having kids. one of the characters is referred to as ""yoga barbie"" because of her blonde hair and perfect body, but she is struggling with her unemployed husband. another woman is trying to get over the loss of her own baby, who died.the most memorable character is becky, who is probably modeled on weiner herself - a spunky, overweight woman who meets life head-on and has an answer for everything. becky's accounts of meeting her husband, the early days of their relationship, and their sexual problems in the beginning, are tragicomic. her skirmishes with her mother-in-law are also entertaining and the outcome is enlightening.",1,128

"like a fine wine!: why this music does not get played on the majority of radio stations is no mystery to me. it shows great talent, is tuneful, one can actually understand the lyrics, and it addresses social issues. not the typical stuff that is played these days on the airwaves of popular music. i feel fortunate that the rest of the world has not discovered what hornsby fans already know. this allows us to enjoy his music live in small intimate theaters where the joy and passion of his music is best experienced. he is a consummate musician who can play virtually any style with ease and continues to challenge himself and the musicians that he surrounds himself with. ""spirit trail"" is yet another classic in the bruce hornsby canon. just like a fine wine, he continues to get better.",1,141
"good read: i enjoyed reading the book, and the price was right. there are stories about how he made his connection with information about how to make your own connection. i would have like to have had more exercises and information about how to make my own psychic connection. even if you think that he is not a true psychic, there are stories out there of him being debunked as a psychic the reading was interesting and the exercises made sense and were helpful.",1,84

"pleasantly surprised!: it seemed i remembered this movie as nothing special, but hey, i got it cheap. well, it turned out my memory is not that good. the film has about as much continuous action as you could ask for in a war movie, and it's all well acted and produced. it doesn't have the character development of the greatest war movies, but it is certainly more enjoyable than most!",1,70
"good read: a typical stuart woods novel. formulaic, some highly improbable feats by the central character, but most of all - entertaining!",1,22
"virtual fireplace: ironically, after having been in the fireplace business for several years, i do not have a fireplace in my home. i have missed not being able to stoke up a fire on a cold and damp day. the ultimate fireplace dvd has been an amazing replacement for the real thing. my wife and i are voracious readers so we curl up in our favorite chairs nightly with our latest books in front of the crackling fire. we have two dogs and it is funny how they start to pant when the fireplace dvd is running. it is so realistic that they are sure they must be getting hot. with christmas around the corner we put on our favorite christmas music and the christmas fireplace scene and our home takes on an idyllic presence with us curled up with a steaming cup of tea or hot cider and the dogs resting beside us. truly a rockwell moment.",1,158

"good memory from childhood: our teacher read this book to us when i was in elementary school, over 30 years ago! and i still remember it. in fact, i have such a fond memory of it that i decided to purchase it for my own child. the book spoke to me as a child as i grew up in my own little secluded valley. a must read for your child!",1,70
"totally a read-again!: wow! this was one of the best books i've ever read. it's just sort of sad that it was a little short, it ended before i wanted it to! to me that is a sign of a really great book. it's inspired me to begin writing a book about vamps, it's just so hard to pry myself away from her wonderful ideas and use my own! great for someone who is looking for a world to escape to, characters to relate to, and senarios to base dreams on (seriously, i mean dreams, not like how you want to live!).over all, an awesome book, the characters appear in my mind so vividly that it's like i know them myself.fellow teens, watch out! get ready to be blown away!oh, yeah. and one more thing, she's completely an inspiration to the writing tallent i've always had, inspiring me to write serious novels! looking for motivation to keep writing? read this and her other works!",1,164

"for people who want to read: this book is a sweet little story of an orphan girl, who is the odd, scruffy little girl of the orphanage. though loved dearly by the teachers/caretakers, she is never up to their expectations. when a trip takes them out of town, a ""substitute"" teacher helps her see that she is lovely as she is. delightful!",1,62

"directing actors: judith weston's directing actors is the oxford dictionary of english for anyone who wants to learn the language that actors and directors speak to each other. it details the work a director must do on their own before meeting with actors if she or he is to be successful in lifting the story to it's most fulfilling expression.judith weston's second book, a film director's intuition, minutely describes every fiber in the strands of the rope that the director must finally use to tie all the elements of the writer's subconscious intention and the actor's sub textual imagination together to express the director's vision that judith's script analysis process produces.both books are generously peppered with hints on how to best use the little, but valuable time on the set, if that is all you have to spend with the actors.karen aschenbach, director",1,143
great movie: this is a great movie... so much so that i want to show it to a friend... i bought it just so that she could see it... the weekend after we saw it... i found that i already owned the movie... so i guess i really like it.,1,50
"amazing: husker du's second album of 1985 was this underrated gem, perhaps their strongest album from front to back. produced now by mould and hart, the sound is brighter, with more attack, almost like power-pop hopped up on hardcore punk. the songs are great, too, with the fantastic makes no sense at all, keep hanging on, divide and conquer, flip your wig, and private plane as some of the strongest. two of the best songs husker du ever recorded, grant hart's beuatiful green eyes, and bob mould's damn-near-perfect games, are the centerpieces of this album, in my opinion. simply jaw-dropping, the both of them. the baby song is a throwaway, but it'll make you laugh. fantastic record, and essential. their last album for sst before moving to warner bros.",1,129
a great start: this book will serve as a great start in learning the basics of setting up a saltwater aquarium. however the book left me with wanting to know more. after reading this book did not feel i had all the necessary knowledge to start my tank.,1,48

"echantment passing through my ears!!!!: i enjoyed this cd very much. this recording has something for everyone. motown (my strongest suit), soul, gospel(the gods love nubia), rock(fortune favors the brave), pop(a step too far), and classic broadway love songs(enchantment passing through, elaborate lives). the album has a great sense of flow from one song to the next, and the story is not very hard to follow, either by listening to the lyrics or reading the synopsis inside the booklet. i am not a fan of elton john, but i found the music very entertaining. whether you like disney, elton john, tim rice, broadway, or just plain good music, there is a strong chance that you will enjoy this cd as much as i did. buy it!!!!",1,126
"great gift!: i bought this as a christmas gift for my boyfriend's parents last year. i included it with some miso soup packages, sesame seeds and a sushi plate set. i really like that it has the bamboo roller as i did a lot of research before making this purchase and read that those are much easier and more efficient for rolling sushi. this package was great and had basically everything, except i wish it included the sesame seeds for what it costs (or used to cost, i see it's about $10 less now). although it was easy to pick up the seeds at my local grocery store, just an extra trip - which nobody likes.it shipped and arrived very timely and in great condition.i can't review on how well everything works as i haven't heard if they've actually made sushi yet, but it definitely looked nice and was very well received!",1,152
"definetly an x-files' classic. more questions arise.: in my opinion the most anxiously awaited season of all. i could barely wait to find out what was going to happen to""spooky."" i found that those navajo indians in these episodes put a nice twist to the show. a must see.",1,49
"ambiguous and ambivalent: all of the le carre novels involve the theme of betrayal and exploitation in some subtle manner. this is one where the main character, as actress, has to betray and exploit herself. she - and by implication, we as readers - never know what is authentic and what is artifice in her. le carre demolishes the distinction. for this very quality she is taken on by the israeli secret service, who need to construct an elaborate but plausible facade. like all le carre's other novels there's an ambivalence about what is right and wrong. the characters are complex, ofttimes confusing in their motives and unsure of the efficacy and rightness of what they're doing. what makes this book unusually troubling is le carre's exposure of the fakeness and schism in the soul of western man.is there anything bona fide and clear about us? is life for us just theatre?",1,152
"wow...normally a counrty fan, but i know my jimmy: i was raised on jimmy buffett, my dad always listens to jimmy, and can usually be seen at his concerts...haha...but i was soooo captivated by this album. its so unique and sly! its not like todays music at all, its almost a new type of music, there is at least 4 sure hits after ""hey good lookin"". a song that is unbelievable is the one featuring toby keith ""piece of work"" (although i hate toby he does wonders for this track)!!!!please listen to this song!!!!!!!!!...album keeps me rockin allllllll night.....this album will rock your socks!",1,104

"six seasons strong: i've been using this mower for the past 6 years, and it is a wonder. the only maintenance that's been required was to replace the batteries after 4 years. other than that (which is to be expected with rechargeables), for the money & the fact that it is electric, it's been a great machine. surprisingly powerful--it seems to cut with the same ease as a gas powered one the same size. if you have a small lawn, this is all you need. even if you have a larger lawn, i would recommend this as a fast ""cut-in"" mower--just as powerful as gas, but much quicker to just grab & go.",1,113
"good lord, what he gets away with: ""silky"" is actually a garage-rock effort, pretty far removed from andre's r&b roots. but it's also the greatest garage-rock album of the '90s, and would have fit right alongside the gories on the crypt records roster of the decade. for a 60+-year-old man, andre's mind is strictly in the juvenile gutter, but at least he's a talented exhibitionist. references to sex (all types) abound, albeit with comparitively little obscenity. two cuts especially, the obvious ""let me put it in"" and the jealously apocalyptic ""everybody knew,"" make him sound like he's in physical pain. he growls, huffs, and doesn't give a damn what you think. what more could you ask?",1,116
"effective!: i have been using no shotgun v3 for a little over a month and it is great! it has given me increased energy throughout my workouts and my strength has increased in a shorter amount of time than without taking it. exotic fuit is a great flavor as well. the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because i did not see the fat burning benefits that was promised. if you are looking for something to increase strength, stamina, and muscle gain, this product is definitely for you!",1,92
"great buy!: i can't believe how heavy this set is! i thought my roommate ordered something when i picked up the box and found it was my poker set. love the clay clinking noise of the chips, great quality carrying case. the cards are cheap, so what. buy new cards.definitely the best deal on poker sets with amazon.",1,58

"cheap, but very high quality: this is a fantastic wok once properly seasoned. i initially seasoned mine 4 times (as suggested by the seller), but with lard instead of oil. the patine is now perfectly non-stick and almost bullet-proof.takes a bit of initial work, but this is now truely my most prized piece of cookware; even better than my stainless/copper italian pots.the flavor that the pan contributes to the food is absolutely unbelievable. furthermore, although the pan is quite ""rough"" looking, it's incredibly durable. my impression is that it's almost impossible to permanently damage this pan... you may have to re-season it, but it'll withstand just about anything. i'd honestly pay upwards of one (or two) hundred dollars for a pan as functional as this wok.",1,126
"capezio women's ds11 fierce dansneaker: capezio women's ds11 fierce dansneakerexcellent shoes for zumba. you can salsa, turn, or chacha easily as it slides on the floor. it also bends easily like a ballet shoes. ordinary sneakers have rubber soles so it gets stuck on the gym floor making it difficult to turn. my street shoes is size 6 but i purchased a size 8 as this dansneaker is narrow and comes small so you need to order 2 sizes bigger. happy zumba!",1,82

"nice, difficult, falling apart pieces: this was one of the hardest puzzles in my experience, but fun anyway. the final completion beautiful. only problem, the tabs on some pieces were falling off before we even sorted out the edge pieces. as we worked on the puzzle the surface cardboard on many many pieces was separating from the back cardboard. i don't think we'll be able to use the puzzle a second time.",1,72
"love this cartridge!: i love the garden images and the special little critters like the caterpillar and the trowel set. i use some glue-on flocking to simulate dirt in the wheelbarrow, as suggested by my local scrapbooking store, and the results catch everyone's eye.",1,44
little slow: really a filler book. good enough in most places to keep you reading but looks like it is really setting the stage for the really big action. i can't wait for the next one...,1,36
"gift for mom's husband...: and he loved it! the watch looks exactly like the photo, the face is shiny, the leather band perfect. the only thing i was a little disappointed with was the ""music"" function, which is fairly soft and in a pretty technologically antiquated mode (it's essentially a single-note midi recording). but the gift went over great, and it's a very nice looking watch.",1,66
"be prepared to cry.: i laughed, i cried. its been quite a while since i read this actually, but whenever books are the topic of conversation i bring this one up. going to buy it for my kindle now so i can reread it.",1,44
"excellent product!: our family purchased this for my grandparents as a gift and they absolutely love it. it works great, i only wish we had come across it sooner. family and friends are able to send pictures, notes, whatever to them and i can manage their account online from my home computer. my only wish is it would somehow let the sender know that the email successfully went through. however, that isn't enough to knock a star down on this item.....it is great!",1,83

"an excellent refence work: yes, this book uses romanization, but there are advantages to using such a system over the native alphabet in analyzing the language. if you're a casual korean language learner, this book is not for you. if you're an advanced student or korean linguist, you'll appreciate this book a lot.",1,53
"thin, light and stylish: i got this watch to replacethis guyand i'm satisfied. the timex is too large and heavy for my wrist: the metal band couldn't get small enough and the heavy watch always made its presence known. the skagen is also noticeably quieter than the timex. why?the skagen is thin and light and i have gotten several unsolicited comments about its attractiveness. i was surprised to see that the numerals are raised and lined in silver, not outlined in white as it seems from the photo.the calendar will be too small for people with bad eyes, the band is a bit complicated to do and undo (it becomes easier with practice) and you have to use a screwdriver to change the size of the band.",1,127

"wonderful!!: this is a great ring. i don't know what roberto is talking about because it look great, like an heirloom. also it feels great on the finger, nicely balanced. i only wish they had more sizes because i go up & down in weight & don't know if i'll be able to still wear it if my fingers get fatter or thinner. they're so inexpensive i wouldn't mind having different sizes but there need to be more to choose from. i picked the size 10 so a size 9 would be good for me too.",1,96
"fantastic achievement: ever since their debut cd ""blush"" this band has remained one of the best kept secrets in the music industry today and their sophomore effort ""cassidy"" is nothing less than stunning in terms of their superb ability to incorporate complex texture and rhythmic layers this band has found a unique voice that makes them stand out from the rest of the trip-hop/electronica bunch which is an acute sense of melodies and a wonderful mixture of atmosphere and substance to make this band a well-rounded musical wonder so long story short this is a fantastic achievement by one of the most under-heard bands on earth today and thank you for reading by the way don't forget to go out and get the cds by alpha they are brilliant.",1,129

"sinbad afros and bellbottoms: i was very excited to get this dvd. i have the vhs tape and my player died. the clarity is great and as usual sinbad is hilarious. the only drawback is the editing. some of the funniest parts were cut. a suggestion to the companies in the future, please put everything on the dvd, that is what the consumer is paying for.",1,66

a page turner: this was my first book by phillip margolin and i enjoyed it alot.very fast moving and somewhat gruesome but good.i was able to figure out who the killer was about halfway through the book but that didn't take away from the suspense.i'll read more of his books-in fact the first chapter of the associate was at the end of this book and the first chapter was enough for me to want to read it.he will be on my authors -to -watch -out- for-list.,1,86
"not that bad: ok, i went into this movie ready to hate it. but i was actually quite happy with the remake. yes it was very much similar to the original, but that appeared to be the idea, just to modernize (in terms of technology) the orginial. further, mia farrow as mrs. balock was fabulous. in the end, it is the same as the orginal and nothing is wrong with that. if anything, the remake brings it closer to home. and for the hater who wrote earlier...the films itself never quotes the year of damien's birth just a month, day and time...try watching before you write a review.",1,108
"whyno reader version: as i move around often, many peachpit press books i buy on the road usually, once throughly perused, end up in the hotel trashcan. kloskowski's excellent pdf tutorial on smart object in ps, merely underscores my desire for publishers to make available pdf (or similar) versions of their texts so that we itinerants can view them and keep them while on-the-road.

"how to take charge of your work: marcus buckingham is passionate about helping you identify your unique strengths and unleash their power. as you read and work your way through the program in this book, you will become convinced that growing through your strengths is the ticket to your future happiness, effectiveness and success. he refutes the approach of improvement by fixing mistakes as a dead end that cannot help you discover how you can be exceptional. the book constantly refers you to its associated web site for materials that will help you work through the exercises. buckingham wants you to act rather than just read a theoretical tract. nothing presented in this book will help you without action and implementation. however, if you take up the challenge, you will become empowered as you take charge of your work through your strengths. we recommend this book because it contains just a few simple ideas that could change your life.",1,159

"getting to know a family next door!: interesting and engaging would be the two words if you were asked to describe the film in just a second. i believe the film leaves no effort in putting things in the most genuine way possible. the film beautifuly depicts the 70's and its quite believable as you witness the settings, the costumes etc. reasonable performence from almost everyone in the film, specially christina ricci as the curious young girl. she delivers an excellent performence, very genuinely shows a sexual maturity in a young girl. her friendship with sandy, her relationship with her father is believable and you can't take your eyes off her. the film will definately grab your attention and you will definately feel you are witnessing a family next door.",1,130

"lovely: practical magic is my first alice hoffman book. it's a fairly quick read, with just the right dynamic of magic and reality. hoffman's writing is at times sensual and moody; others it is light and subtle. it's a stirring contrast. hoffman has a real knack for romance, too. the way she describes the various loves of the owens girls is raw, dramatic, yet not completely unrealistic.awesome book. i read it in two sittings.",1,74

"amazingly good for the price: before the holidays, i shopped around for an ""inexpensive"" digital. i hated to spend big money on something that will be obsolete in a year or two. (i already have an entire shelf in my basement with computer equipment we no longer use) amazon listed this as one of the 10 best cameras, so for [the price], what did i have to lose. i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the image. (i am a comercial artist) print it out on a good ink jet printer, on photo quality paper, and you get great results. plus, i can use it on my mac and my husbands pc. installation on both platforms was super simple. you don't need any kind of real computer experience to be able to download from camera to computer. i plan to buy another for my in-laws. it's no nikon, but i'd definatly recommend it to anyone wanting to get an easy to use digital.",1,164
"excellent: i have to wholeheartedly agree with all the reviewers (only 3 at time of writing).this film is simple in premise, it lacks on hollywoodisation and the budget that goes with it but holds and grips from 1st scene to last. the few characters in the film are simply all you need to remind you of life and what makes you think.i have attempted to get my fiancee to watch this film (""is it subtitles?!"") but im sure when she does watch this she will love it. lord of the rings this is not (also very good but flawed) it is the best foreign film i have seen since cinema paradiso.watch and enjoy :)",1,114

"continent in a book: this book contains a survey of food across africa. the author, a food historian, draws on her many experiences traveling through the continent in this collection of recipes. the recipes are authentic and tasty, and many of them are quite easy to prepare. however, i found a few of them a little unrealistic (such as frying slices of four small eggplants in a single tablespoon of olive oil without so much as soaking them in saltwater first), leaving me wondering to what extent harris had actually tested the recipes. nonetheless, overall the book contains many exciting recipes and would make a welcome addition to the library of any adventurous cook.",1,114

"excellent review and a real benefit for practical work: this is the first powerbuilder book, i read that seems to be not only a compendium but delivers as well many pratical nice choosen examples. on the first look, you got the impression that this is only an adapted book to the next version, but if you really take a look you will remark many details which are carefully done. i recommend that book to all newcomers to powerbuilder as well as a to experienced developers. the index is very well done.",1,91
"outfoxed hits home: i was surprised today to flip by fox and see michael moore ... being interviewed courteously. obviously outfoxed has forced them to try to change their image. those who agree that calling it fox ""news"" is a travesty should go to moveon.org and sign the petition to congress to address the issue.",1,55

kids loved it!: the cutest story ever! the kids loved it! the illustrations are awesome. i would recomend this story for the primary grades or even older students learning to deal with individual differences.,1,34
"good for starting a collection: i have liked almost every recipe that i have tried from this book. i have purchased it twice. once for myself and once as a gift for a friend. i would recommend it for anyone starting out a vegan kitchen. if you already have loads of vegan cookbooks, you might want to just skip this one and get a specialty cookbook like ""the mediterrean vegan kitchen"".",1,71
"execellent, reliable, compact: my most recent purchases of the rome inside-out city guides represent a replacement for one i literally wore out after three trips and constant use, as well as two for gifts for our two grandchildren who will be traveling with us. these guides are easy to use and contain an amazing amount of information in a packet about the size of a purse-size pocket calendar.",1,68
"another great book!: i have read most all of nouwen's books - each are written from the attitude of knowing and serving a god who loves us and wants to be in relationship with those he created. in the living reminder, nouwen emphasizes the importance of remembering where god has brought us from and where he is leading us to go. it is a book for everyone who wishes to minister to the hurting around them (pastors, counselors, laity). the book is short and easy to read - yet profound and encouraging. i highly recommend all of nouwen's books for those who are searching for a closer walk with god.",1,110
"enjoyable story for the holidays: this book is light reading, very enjoyable and good for some laughs. it highlights the competition of neighbors trying to ""out do"" each other in their holiday festivities, how every organization comes alive for their annual collection and, in all, how commercial the season of christmas has become. the end has a twist and in it, reveals the true meaning of christmas present under all the decorations, festivities and commercialism. i would recommend this book - i enjoyed it.",1,84
"thank you ms. hamilton!: this book got under my skin and will stay there. the prose is wonderful. i kept jotting down my favorite passages, especially the ones about 'is that all there is?' concerning work down at the trim'n tidy. i compare this to winter birds by jim grimsley",1,50
"a tough read, but worthwhile...: ...but what else would you expect from a book with a title like that?pinker has some fine insights into our thought processes, and it got me thinking on many an occasion.however, there did seem to be a few things that he didn't touch upon which i found unsatisfying. here's one: he spoke of the ""language of music"", but there is a lower-level discussion to be had; *why* do we associate low, deep sounds with power, foreboding and fear? *why* do high, piercing sounds denote energy, movement and alarm? do these relate to our distant past in the wild, or are there other psycho-acoustic reasons?couple this book with robert wright's ""nonzero"", and you pretty much have an abbreviated profile of the driving forces behind the mind of the modern human.the mind is an amazing thing.",1,139
"the perfect gift: i purchased this mp3 player for my friends birthday, and he really loved it. it was such a good deal, only 45$ and the perfect example of new music technolagy. he carries it everywhere, in his smallest pocket, and is able to listen to over 100 hours of any songs on the web. now thats a real deal. listening to the best artists in the world from a 2-ounce device. yepp has perfected music.",1,77
"pleasant and sophisticated: i purchased this product for my son. he really likes it. he thinks it is to be used more for formal occasions than for everyday use, and will not use it for 'hanging out', possibly for work on some days. i find it to be pleasantly deep-scented without being overpowering.",1,53
"perfect for at the park: blanket is the perfect size, easy to carry, lightweight. the waterproofing back definitely works. tricky to fold back up the first couple of times but then you get the hang of it. only complaint - lint fuzzies come up even after washing, have to brush them off your clothes after sitting on the blanket.",1,59
"really should be 10 stars... buy this book now: i've always loved the fat!so? zine... and was extremely excited to find out there was a book. you need to buy this book.... but not just one copy. buy one for all your friends (fat and thin... because we all know that the thin girls still think they're fat). buy copies for your local libraries and schools. give copies to teen-age girls you might know. (does amazon sell by the case?) this is the funniest, most self-empowering book i've read in my life. oh... and before you go to bed tonight... thank god for giving us marilyn wann. if you're just beginning to try to accept your body, i recommend this book. i also recommend joining naafa and attending some of their events.... you'll find out that no matter what your size, somebody will think you're fabulous just the way you are (heck, might even be too skinny for some guys). :)",1,161
"a scholarly work - the split of judaism and christianity: sigal's doctoral work on the development of judaism - may help you understand the rift between judaism and christianity, i would have given it 5 well earned stars, but the material is dry and difficult, unless you treasure the wealth of references and critical analysis.for jews, you learn the varied practices and philosophies in early jewish history.for christians, the origin of the religion and perhaps great insight into your faith and the relationship to modern judaism.",1,86
good retrospective: this is a good retrospective on van morrison's work. you'll get a real good feel for the depth and breadth of a long career that has touched upon and added to many a musical genre. new takes on a few of his classic songs make this an enjoyable listen and good addition one's musical collection.,1,57
"a must buy: having no idea what to expect before going to my first rebecca's statue show, i asked around. ""like phish, but more bluesy."", some said. ""highly inspirational"", a rollicking young hipster blurted out. the statue was all these things, and then some. but could they make an album? many spectacular live bands have trouble going from the live world to the studio world. well simply put, they got it taken care of. this album ranks high among my favorites. the statue is one of those bands that has so many influences it would be impossible to name a few bands or styles as their influence. all i can say is that i've played this cd for fans of jazz, blues, hard rock, pop, and bluegrass, and all of those people have bought ""drinking from the water clock"", or gone to a statue show. you will not be disappointed with this disc.",1,153
"half the songs are great. the other half, so-so.: i got this album years ago on the strength of the remarkably depressing ""twist in my sobriety,"" a great song that got a tiny bit of airplay. i still listen to the cd today, but only selected tracks - most of which, sadly, aren't the tracks that amazon chose to feature audio samples of (with the exception of the bitter ""i love you""). a lot of the tracks on the first half of the album are somewhat bland folk-pop. but let me alert you to the jazzy tornado of ""for all these years"" (trumpet by the great mark isham), the bluesy epic ""he likes the sun"" and what has got to be one of the most wildly romantic ballads i have ever heard, ""valentine heart."" those, with ""i love you"" and ""twist in my sobriety,"" are wonderful, wonderful songs, and make the album worthy of buying.",1,155
"better than expected: every time i use my dremel, i am more amazed. my husband and i redid are bathroom tile and this bit was very helpful....went through the grout like butter! :-)",1,33
"mind blowing and smart science fiction: i believe ghost in the shell is one of the seminal films of recent japanese cinema. the plot involves a female cyborg, named the major, who works for a mysterious government agency named section nine. the major is assigned to capture a superhacker known as ""the puppet master."" what could have been a routine chase flick becomes a masterpiece in which questions about existence and what constitutes a soul are explored. the end of the picture is one of the most dizzying finales ever put on film. don't miss this ground breaking motion picture.preston mcclear, malibubooks.com",1,102
"incredible perspective: i would highly recommend that you sit down with your partner and read this book to each other. roger housden is an extraordinary writer and this book is a joy to read. especially for those of us that feel we need to have things tightly under control. he makes it clear that it is ok ""not to know it all"", it is ok to spend time doing absolutely nothing, and other very useful insights.",1,76
"extremely insightful: i have read virtually everything i can find dealing with theology and animals, because of my strong interest in both, and i find this is the most insightful book in print. webb offers profound wisdom in his thinking about human/animal relations from a judeo-christian perspective, and his analysis of other writers' thoughts is very cogent. this is a serious and challenging book, but it is so well-written that it should be readily accessible to wide audiences.steve",1,78
"half bottle decanter perfect size: this decanter was well packaged and arrived quickly. i gave it as a gift to some wine loving friends. they had admired ours previously and we new that this would be good gift. most decanters are too big for the table, too big for two people who may not drink a whole bottle in one night. this small size airs half bottle elegantly. it cleans easier than a big decanter and take far less space to store due to its smaller base. a practical wine gift.",1,91
"sturdy, comfortable, good sound: i needed headphones to use in a workshop situation where i have 10-20 people listening to a single sound source. when i saw these headphones with the extra long cords and volume control, i was instantly sold.the straight style cord is good for bundling, storage and moving. i have another pair of headphones with a curly cord that is a pain to untangle after they have been in a bag.the over the ear cup design is perfect to insulate people from outside sounds. they are adjustable for different head shapes and sizes. the sound quality is good (not excellent), but adequate for my needs. they are sturdy, so i don't worry about them getting broken during transport.if you are buying many headphones for public use, i really think these can't be beat.",1,136
"pleasantly surprised: she writes with a style of simplicity and rhythym and ease that you can sit down and read the book in one sitting. there are few if any dry spots. it flows very well, and you can see the characters and events clearly. she must be proud to be a new author and have produced such a successful work.",1,61
"wow thats a great rock record.: the alkaline trio is a damn fine rock group and this is a wonderful album, records as good as this are truly few and far between. these fellows play emotional rock-punk that i wouldnt necesarrily classify as ""emo"", but regardless of labels it is just grrreat music. matt skibba is a super songwriter/vocalist/lyricist, i just love it. buy this record!",1,66
billy crystal: three of billy crystal's best early works. great price. awesome service by amazon. always love doing business with amazon. easy to use.,1,24
"saitek eclipse ii: it is well made keyboard. it has a nice feel to it and the adjustable lighting is just what i was looking for. it does lack extra multimedia functions but does have the basic ""stop, play, pause etc..."". it's a keeper.",1,44
works as advertised. easy to install. couldn't be simpler.: works as advertised. easy to install. couldn't be simpler. we have the bell receiver located in an addition about 50 feet from the transmitter. the signal has to go through two outside walls covered with aluminum siding (or it's bouncing through the house?). works fine and solve our problem of not hearing the doorbell when working in that part of the house.later: it's now been installed more than 3 years. still works fine.,1,82
"great wild album!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: this album was the first i ever herd buddy rich play. i was already a drummer 13 years and hadn't herd any of buddy's playing on record. this is his most famous cd of his 1960's big band albums he did on pacific jazz, and it's my favorite. highlights of this album are of course, west side story, and apples, but hoe down, basically blues, what did i say, and uptight are also of my musical enjoyments. i don't think there was a drummer who wasn't influenced by buddy rich, and this cd is why! any drummer or jazz fan will like this album.",1,107
"this cd rules!: this cd really bring you back to the honky tonk days, when beer was cheap & so were the women. johnny dilks & his fellas really know how to get your toes a tappin'",1,37
"for completely clean humor it is really funny: i was surprised at how funny these comedians were. i was also very pleased with the variety of acts there were. the first comedian was funny in his own right (used a lot of one liners) but also used a lot of facial expressions and hand gestures in addition to his humor. the next comedian was very dry but at the same time funny. he was a little slow at first, but once he got going it was funny. the next guy was more of a prop comedian and did a great job with it.i definitely recommend this dvd. i greatly enjoyed watching. with that said, these are not shows you would consider headliner comedians. however, they are quite enjoyable.",1,128
"the practice tests in this book gave me a good workout.: principles are taught with practice afterward. there are five complete practice tests provided. there appear to be some errors in the book and the paper is the cheap stuff. this book is consumable if you work all the tests and write essays in it as i did. i took the test last weekend and i felt confident afterward, though i haven't gotten my score yet.",1,76
"great for stainless steel: this stuff is like magic. i used it on a stainless steel revolver with a dull, lifeless finish. an hour's easy work and it was gleaming and mirror-like. encouraged by this i tried it on a set of 40 year old stainless steel flatware that had long lost its shine and had resisted any efforts to restore it with other polishes. once again the mothers did the trick (and without much rubbing either.) the flatware doesn't look quite new, but the mothers definitely removed at least 30 years of staining. i am seriously impressed.",1,98
"great snap opener: this is great for anyone who has problem with there hands. super easy unsnap, really haven't used it alot to snap. i have a boat cover and this works great will definately help the cover to last longer.",1,41
"great toaster oven: i really love this oven. the toaster feature at the top is great!! if you plan on doing cooking in the oven, it is important to preheat and turn the tray from front to back halfway through the cooking time. things",1,44
playpen: this playpen is a great one i love how the basient is on the top and it is so easy to set up it will be well used,1,29
"even my gramma loved this album..: i didn't even like country music when i purchased the lp back in the sixties. i'm not sure what prompted me, i guess i figured that if the byrds did it, it must be okay. i had no idea the album would blow me and my friends totally away. this is an every song is a winner album and an album that was instrumental in my adding country music to my ever widening musical tastes.",1,81
dirt devil type u vacuum bags: a pack of ten? who could ask for anything more (or anything so inexpensive)? great bargain. great little vacuum. you can't go wrong with dirt devil.,1,32
"love it!: instructions easy to follow, light weight, excellent clarity even in windy conditions, user friendly, and very confortable to wear.love it, love it!",1,24
i love this book!: this is a really good book. i like the part where laura takes the crab out of the creek and it chases nellie. nellie is such a snob.,1,32
"awesome: this is an amazing book that should be required reading for everyone 16 years of age and older. uplifting, inspiring, terrifying, compelling, tragic, funny, informative, educational--all of those things. i welled up with sadness several times while reading this. other times my heart swelled with pride for my country and fellow americans. durant is a great american. he even has a great sarcastic sense of humor, even in the worst of times. i was laughing out loud at a few of his comments. read this along with black hawk down and you'll get a great perspective. never once did i feel that this book was somehow redundant for me after reading bhd.buy it now!!!!!!!!!!",1,115
"sulfate free!!!!: i have sensitivities to sulfates in shampoos. this shampoo has solved my problems. because it is sulfate free it won't lather up as much as typical shampoos, because of this is also doesn't strip natural oils out of hair. it leaves the moisture in my hair while cleaning it. it has a natural light citrus scent that isn't overly perfumey like a lot of shampoos. great for curly hair!",1,71
"best investment i ever made for my twin babies: my twins started to play in this everyday since they were 4 month-old. they are 6.5 months now. my little boy can walk and run in this for about 40 minutes at a time. he plays with the piano, chews on the bird and tree, and hits the dauphin real hard. he has not mastered the other toys, he will over time. my little girl is not as strong or as tall. she walks a lillte slow. she would dance with the music every time she plays the piano. they both had so much fun. it worth every penny we spent!",1,110
"high quality - but slow leak: the ball came quickly and is made of a very durable material. i really enjoyed this product and use it daily. however, with excessive use there is a small leak - i need to blow mine up again every week. but i use it for 100 situps a night.i would recommend this product to others.",1,61
"fun, easy to use, and makes a great keepsake!: this book is so cute and was just what i needed to inspire me to write about my pregnancy. i wanted to record it by journaling, but had bought and returned three journals already (they did not inspire me) before a friend recommended buying this one. the little prompts are perfect, and the picture/word space ratio is pretty good - if i had no picture but lots to write, i would just write where there would have been a picture, or all around the space for the picture. and it's a fun, easy way to share what's going on with my pregnancy without having to tell the same story over and over. i'm just beginning my second trimester and i am loving this little book!",1,134
"woah! welcome to the sounds of ""new"" america!: this is no doubt the best song that i've heard that have come out in response to the september 11th attacks. tippin adds his strong voice to what will surely become an anthem for america. it will stand the test of time, as surely songs like live's ""overcome,"" paul mccartney's ""freedom,"" and the brand new version of ""god bless the u.s.a."" by christian band jump5 will. i thank my lord and savior jesus christ for not only giving me the gift of life and eternal salvation, but giving me the privilege of being born in this god-blessed country. let us move forward, and move on to triumphant victory in the new war on terrorism. buy the single, and be proud that you've been blessed by god to live in america. grade: a+",1,140
excuse me!`: very cute children's book that teaches manners! this was an important purchase for me as i would like to instill good manners in my son & this book demonstrates appropriate situations for these manners to be tested out on. great pictures as well.,1,45
"works great for porch tv: it took me about 10 minutes to unpack, scan the instructions, and connect the sender and receiver - and another 5 minutes to find the receiving channel and fine-tune the sender/receiver. the receiver is connected to an old tv on the porch - about 50 feet and 3 walls from the sender. the picture and sound are very good - we're looking forward to warmer weather and watching the news on the porch.",1,78
"great for the bbq: i bought this quality constructed pan to use on my bbq. being afraid of metal changes from the high temperatures of a bbq, i knew that cast iron would maintain its integrity. i can use my bbq quite like an oven now.",1,46
really cool book: i think this book was the best. i loved it. the dog dying was a very sad part. this is the best book i ever read before. i hope to read more books like this.,1,38
"bulky but good: as other reviewers have mentioned, the handles are comfortable but heavy. then end of the spatulas are kind of big, but i can get by with them since my few nonstick pans are rather large any way. i wish the handles were of silicon as well. unfortunately i have melted the bottom of the handles where they rest on the pan if you don't take it out. the spoons are cartoonishly large though. i have not even attempted to use them. they need to be slightly smaller and about half as thick as they are. the spatulas are soft and pliable but work very well, much better than any plastic spatula i have ever used.",1,118
"an example for everyone: this novel is a shining example of how to make a faery tale fit into our contemporary lives. the spirit is still the same, and the dangers are still as real; but they're brought to a level that the modern person can empathise with. from snohamish's drug use, to the abuse and mistreatment of cindy ellis and little hank and gigi. even diego, with his ""puss and boots"" storyline is more real and heart wrenching than any ""real crime"" drama.",1,84
"yes tony you to know how we like to dance: get it is nice mix with dance ,tribal,and house i guess u like like it so don't thinking too much just buy it .........",1,34
"works great: i had to call to set up the device because i wanted it to be seperate from the answering machine and the telephones. it is just connected to the computer to route special ring faxes to the computer. after talking to the rep. and getting it programed, it has worked as advertised. no complaints.",1,56
"good deal: for a one time use, this is a great purchase. i'm not sure how well these hats will hold up with long term use. i was pleased with them though.",1,32
"terrific blender: for years i have been putting up with a poorly designed kitchen aid blender that always made a mess. i paid a lot of money for it too. after cleaning another mess the other day i decided to throw it out.thanks to all of you for your reviews. i decided to get this blender.it's everything i wanted in a blender, fast, doesn't overflow, and, while it looks as tho it doesn't hold as much as my old blender, it does.instead of having chunks of berries left in the bottom, it blends them in with smoothies. it's fast too.so, it's noisy. so what. it only takes seconds and i don't think you could have such a large motor and quiet. i'd rather have the horsepower.i don't think you can go wrong buying this blender.almost 3 years later:the blender is still performing, even grinds small amounts of grain like flax seed, oatmeal. best blender i've ever had.",1,157
"the best book i've read this year: breaks down the law of attraction in such away that it is actually understandable. truely the most practical, useful & inspiring book i've read all year. if you are looking for ways to improve your life, step by step, with out judgement or boundry this is a great book to get you on that path. i reccomend it to all my friends.",1,69
perfect story...: i thought god's gift to women was the perfect book to snuggle up with at night. the only trouble i had was being able to put it down after a few chapters of reading...needless to say i stayed awake all night to finish the story...making me late for work the next day!,1,54
anyway: only song i really know on this album is anyway. beautiful song . . . makes you think about really being jesus to the world around us (even/especially when it's not easy).,1,33
works great: i purchased this instead of buying a headrest mount dvd player. we've had a couple cheap portable dvd players from target laying around from christmas last year and i figured why not use those? they really weren't getting any use around the house.the kids (ages 4 and 7) seem to have this setup figured out now and our initial dvd player is still going strong. if nothing else i'm getting use out of something that would have just sat in a room. good price and works well for what it is.,1,93
"it's a good book but you have to know dobson to appreciate: james dobsons war on america shows the machivelian face of the noted author and radio talk show host .sounding silky smooth and oh- so pious isn't enough to cover up his "" plot"" to move america out of democracy and to theocracy under the guise of religious persecution.",1,60
"wow!!! no other pirate movie will ever be able to compete!!!: wow!!! i have never seen a better blockbuster than this. i've seen it three times and i just want to go back again and again. orlando bloom is hott and johnny depp is absolutely hilarious. there's so much action and it just doesn't stop. this movie doesn't lack anything. it has adventure, romance, comedy, great graphics, scary moments, fantasy,and most important johnny depp and orlando bloom. i give it 5 stars. i'ld give it more but i'm not allowed. no other pirate movie will be able to compete. i will for sure be buying this movie. if i were you i wouldn't miss this one.",1,116
"well done: i found tangents to be an intriguing and enjoyable journey through the mind of the author. while remaining true to it's name, i think it maintains a consistent underlying hum of fluidity that never drops you in the middle of no where. it's poetic, introspective and often relatable. it's darker tones echo the confusions of today's world while it's lighter side reflects the inner peace of understanding. reminiscent of a young kerouac, it's pieces of ordinary life through the eyes of a mind in search of life's truths.",1,90
"a ""must see"" for everyone!: the criticism is unwarranted. this mini-series doesn't portray anything controversial that we don't already know. instead though, you get real insight to the passionate, but flawed family, their agony behind difficult decisions, and the heart they had to make things better for this country. way too many tragedies for one family to endure. the acting is superb, not just bobby's character, but tom wilkinson and greg kinnear were spectacular and robbed from critical acclaim. other performers were also strong with frank sinatra's character as the weak exception. not only have i watched this twice, i've bought it! great history for our kids as well.the kennedys",1,110
"spies: risk, danger & double lives: this is a good movie on the subject of spying which covers a lot of old ground ( ie: wwii) to fill up space. still, there were some revolations in that part of the movie that were new to me and for an amature historian like me, that's rare. the present day research was very good. this movie is worth the money.",1,68
"""i'll play it, then tell you what it is later."": the title of this short and sweet review refers to miles talking to bob weinstock, owner/producer of prestige records, who was asking miles what was the name of a tune he was about to play. ""cookin' with the miles davis quintet"" is exactly what this recording does from start to finish. miles was joined by his then, classic quintet: john coltrane on tenor saxophone, red garland on piano, paul chambers on bass, and philly joe jones on drums. when you hear ""cookin"" you're going to want everything miles did on prestige, because it's that good. highly recommended.",1,107
"brake fast bowl works: the bowl definitely works. the dog eats his food much more slowly. the cons of this product are that it is so light weight plastic that it slides too much. to solve the problem, i went to a discount store and bought a cheap metal bowl and took the rubber ring off of the base and put it on this bowl. that helps a lot.the second con is the price. i think the price is outrageous for a piece of molded plastic.",1,86
"it actually works!: comes with everything needed to view over the air hd except for the tv itself. you don't need any additional cabling...even though amazon tries to sell you hdmi cables with it... anyways, i recommend this product, a must have for broadcast hdtv. i get stations that barely came in with a regular antenna, and every station comes in clear with great signal!",1,65
rubberfantastic: this movie was frikin amazing. broke all the genres and tears are running down my face. i cant tell if there tears of joy or tears of sadness but man that was amazing. keep trying tire,1,37

"great follow up to ""rich dad poor dad"": this book is a fantastic sequel to ""rich dad, poor dad"". while the first rich dad book laid a great foundation and provided some high level direction, this book took what i had learned and added to it. there are some repeat ""lessons"" but they tend to go more in depth and have different examples that help me have a better understanding of the concept. in one of the books rtk uses an example of the financial education that you need to be financially free and compares it to the foundation of a building. these books are helping me lay that strong foundation.as a side note, i listened to the audio cd version of this book and the only things i didn't like were the speakers voice (very robot-sounding) and the fact that every time he mentioned a particular quadrant, he had to say both the letter and name of the quadrant... this got a bit tiresome and a bit sesame street sounding (ie ""b, business"", ""i, investor"").",1,176
"it's just a fan: i don't know, maybe it's just me, but the other reviews on this item made it sound like this fan was some miraculous new advance in electric fan technology. i bought it, and i'm satisfied with my purchase, but so far it hasn't radically changed my life and i'm not in any hurry to tell all my friends to go out and buy 10 of them. it's a fan. you turn it on, it blows air. it doesn't seem to blow air any further than any other fan i've had. it works fine in my average-sized bedroom. it is pretty quiet and is small, two features i like. i think i'd like it a little more if it had the ability to oscillate back and forth.",1,130
"gift bought for mom: i just bought this for my mom for mother's day. i don't even like keith urban or country. but, i know she enjoyed it.",1,28
"work it!: the book arrived in the mail a whole lot smaller than i thought it would be- but that didn't ultimately matter after i read it. ""it works"" is an amazing, yet effective little book that gets your life working by having you set goals and concentrate on them. in time, all this positive thinking pays off and you get closer to where you want to be.well worth the read, there's a good reason this little volume had been around for so long. other self-help books i liked that help you get your life going include ""the sixty-second motivator.""",1,100
"tireless action, superb prose: this riveting account of life-and-death drama under the seas competes with any fictional submarine tale. the hopeless state of the soviet navy recounted in such detail in this book makes the tragic sinking of the kursk much easier to understand. hostile waters gives an incredible inside look at a band-aid navy that still suffers from mishap and disaster. the heroism of the crew constrasts sharply with the unfeeling disregard of the soviet high command for the well-being of the sailors. for engrossing reading, this book stands at the top.",1,93
good movie!: borrowed movie from friend and liked it so i bought it! very good if you like movies with vampires and the supernatural!,1,24
"must have: this is the best cd i own i bought it in 05' and i still listen to it often. i like every song and i don't skip over any tracks. he is the only artist where i like every single song on all 7 of his albums. i repurchased this cd recently only to get the bonus dvd. it was well worth it. he is so talented. he gives a spectacular live show so go see him. his cd's include in order of release: australia, howie day live ep, the madrigals ep, stop all the world now, live from from ep, sound the alarm, ceasefire.",1,107
"hugo press: its a great press although i must admit i dont use it much, i use the press mostly for thai tea, not coffee. it does a decent job at straining the grains but it could be a bit better. the only complaint is that the lid is flimsy and loose. i assume it is loose to let air out.",1,61
"i gave the bad review below: it is not as bad as i said below. i just had to get used to it. although a copy of the original recording of these songs would be better, this is pretty good.",1,40
"the purple cow is a long time ago being: i apologize for my english because i'm a french reader(paris).""the purple cow"" is a marketing easy reading book with lots of cases and success stories. i always wonder reading this kind of book if it was so easy to make a successful brand like to make a good cake. i'm sure it's not. the author seems to know all the keys of marketing and resume them in one idea : be remarkable. isn't it too simplistic ? and what about be unremarkable by being always remarkable,think of united colors of benetton. the question is not approached. but the book is a good distraction for thoses who are interesting in funny and rationnal marketing short cuts. anyway, remain to think in a singular way is always a good work to do in any job. then, the purple cow is a useful training in this way. enjoy your reading.",1,156
hell's angel: the life and times of sonny barger and the hell's angels motorcycle club: i bought this book for my brother-in-law. so i had to ask him what he thought. he told me how much he enjoyed the book. so buy this book for anybody that is a biker or a biker at heart.,1,55
ronnie brown jersey: this jersey was a christmas gift for my son-in-law who is a die-hard dolphins fan. it replaced other dolphin gifts that i had purchased and were accidently tossed out. it arrived just before christmas and needless to say he was one very happy fellow.,1,47
"just what i needed: the set heats quickly and uniformly. it is attractive, easy to use, and easy to clean. love the glass lids and sturdy handles. they are perfect for everyday cooking - unless you are a gormet cook (in which case you are probably spending a lot more money than these).",1,53
"a nice mouse, but the cordless version is less reliable...: get the wired version of this mouse. it's quite comfortable, and very good for gaming, and such. i would say the wireless version is much more reliable, and more likely to work. keep this in mind, wireless tech just isn't perfected yet.",1,52
"nice polish: i did some price shopping on this item and saw it described in other places as ""bright pink"" with ""subtle pink and purple micro shimmer"". well the micro-shimmer is so subtle you pretty much cant see it. this is a beautiful color dont get me wrong. just keep in mind it is more of a deep pink rose color.not bright pink. and it has what they call a creme finish.i am an opi fan, it lasts (on your nails) a good while. i dont know that it lasts the longest. i'm off to try china glaze next.if you need a pink bright enough to stand out when going out yet tame enough for work i think this is a great medium.",1,123
"best i found yet: these were purchased for my bosch orbital sander. they work great, especially if one remembers to start and stop the sander when it is on the wood. otherwise it could come flying off after some use; but when used diligently as directed, works great. so much better than anything i found at the big box stores, who never really have a wide selection of anything decent.",1,70
very readable and generally good book: i can't believe the shitty book that i was forced to try to read for my course. this one gives you a good picture of what's relevant. i'll toss this one in since everyone else has - it has excellent tables. i rate them book as execellent. don't force yourself to read another book. there's nothing to understand in micro - just memorize it. this book makes it easier. i only wish i had had this as a text for the course!,1,88
"wonderful cookbook: i read this cover to cover and enjoyed every delicious word! yum. i love to cook this way anyway, and having just returned from the mediterranean, i had a great appreciation for the menus and foods (which i just recently ate - double yum). i'm excited to have this in my inventory of cookbooks.",1,56
"knotwork: i have not yet drawn knots from this book, but i have worked through celtic knots-mastering the traditional pattern which i recommend at a first book for beginners like myself. however, i had read this book and can't wait to start drawing its knots.",1,45
"great for beginners, intermediate and experts: this was a great game for my 6 year old son. he's been playing chess for about 6 months and knows the basics. i wanted him to start to learn and understand strategy. this software reinforced the basic principles of the game, plus taught him some things that the book we checked out of the library didn't tell him. when he and i started playing regular games on his chess board, i was amazed at the strategies he was employing and the moves he was making based on what he learned from this computer game. even my husband, who is a very good chess player, enjoyed playing the computer game and it gave father and son yet another fun activity to share. i highly recommend this product for young children at any level.",1,139
"cow must-have!: great book if you are thinking about getting a family cow, really the best book i've found on the subject. i love the author's tone and also like checking her webpage info that supports this book!",1,38
"screw cowbell. more accordion!: while his latest album isn't my favorite (largely due to my self-imposed ignorance of most of the bubblegum pop-tarts he's parodying) al is still the man and brings a very entertaining show. i was especially happy to see him play the accordion (and keytar!) on about half the songs in the setlist. seems like he only played it for a few tracks on the last (and also amazing) concert dvd.i saw him live 4 times before i became a father (touring on 3d, dare to be stupid, off the deep end and running with scissors) and look forward to taking my kids to his show next time he plays near us.",1,115
keeps baby entertained!: this is a great colorful video for baby. keeps her entertained so i could have time to myself.,1,21
everything old is new again: the acting is wonderful. the script is super. i was compelled to add it to my collection now to show to my grandchildren. we are again in a cycle of repressive political correctness and have to learn to laugh again.,1,45
"good book: i have read this book, and thought it was definitely well done. it explained the tools, supplies, and the knowledge you will need to be a competent robot builder. at the end of a book is a detailed list of books, magazines and web sites for where you can go from this book. the book was great, although the only thing i didn't like was that the three projects were hard to follow. i didn't quite understand all of the actions i needed to take, and these chapters lost me pretty quicky.still, the book is great to get you going, and has an excellent amount of resources at the end, and i like the author a lot and hope to read another of his books later.",1,128
"hey, paul's not so bad!: i approached reading about paul with a bad attitude.i kinda like the guy now - marion soards is brilliant! some of the bad rap that paul has gotten is just that - a bad rap.thanks, dr. soards",1,42
"good set: good little set here. lots of fun elements and good pose-ability. the lobster cant quite support itself on its little legs and the tips will frequently pop off (easy enough to put back on). paid fifteen bucks for this so its a great value; two minifigs, lots of uncommon pieces, even a couple printed pieces. i'll keep it out on display for a bit before taking it all apart and adding it to my collection.",1,77
"my hummingbirds: the hummingbirds are feeding from the feeder, they're happy and so am i. it is small enough for the birds that come into the yard, it's perfect.",1,29
"outstanding film for everyone!: i saw a premier showing of jonah and i could not believe the quality of the animation, the incredible music, and a very well told story. i thought every aspect was outstanding. my kids are 6 & 9 and they loved it and were singing the songs afterwards. as a dad i thought it provided positive messages i want reinforced in my children. i cannot recommend it highly enough. it is certainly one of the the best kids movies i have seen. in fact, if i did not have kids i would have loved it too.",1,100
"the best film in history 100%: this is the best film in the history of moviemaking. if you are a person that likes cartoons, but wishes that they looked more real, this is the best movie that you will ever see. it is also one of the last real handdrawn antimated films, handrawn all the way through. i would definatly buy this film. the stereo surround sound also kicks. igive this film a 1000,000% rating, as being the best film ever made, period.",1,83
"this book saved my butt!: i am a cinema major at san francisco state university, and one of the classes i'm in right now is ""film and the holocaust."" we watched shoah in that class, and the final exam is based solely on that film. this book, which is a transcript of the entire film, word-for-word, is a crucial study aid for me. i don't know what i would have done without it. thank you claude lanzmann for making this book availible to the public!!!!!shoah: the complete text of the acclaimed holocaust film",1,93
"good to start with..: this is a good book to start with but definitely not the ""all in one"" xslt book.i would suggest to start xslt with this book and then read ""learning xslt"" as well as ""xslt cookbook"".that combination would make you an expert in a couple of days.this book follows the example of planets.xml and uses it consistently, but the example gets boring after a while.",1,68
"the authentic spirit of zarzuela: other than his virtuosity as a lyric tenor, placido exhibits at large his innate attributes of spanish singer; surely the mark of his parents placido and pepita embil both zarzuela singers. the adorable presence and voice of ana maria martínez, so natural and versatile in her expression, and with those sweet and clean altos, make of her the perfect mate to placido in this style. the conductor lópez-cobos succeeds in drawing the spirit and rythm of zarzuela from the fine mozarteum orchestra. though i missed some emblematic zarzuelas like los gavilanes and la leyenda del beso, this dvd is the most enjoyable fiesta madrileña.",1,109
"amazing cd: if you enjoy listening to something corporate, you are bound to enjoy jack's mannequin's ""everything in transit."" andrew mcmahon's enchanting voice and impressive lyrics make this album the outstanding record that it is.",1,35
"russell watson is versatile: russell's versatility talent is shown on this album. the voice is just the voice. this one is not like his albums before which have many classic songs (kind of tenor)that for some is unlistenable,:)(you know..)i am not particularly fan of certain kind music. i do like pop,rock,classical,jazz or should i just say good music.so, now we have frank sinatra songs covered by russell here. though i am not fans of frank sinatra before, i can say i really enjoy this cd and that make me want to collect some sinatra's album.last, i would say as a fan of russell's voice, for non classical audience this is the voice for you to enjoy.",1,116
"i really liked it: this was a truly sweet and romantic story. this was a love story. but it is the wonderful characters that make this book a hit. samantha and eric are amazing on their own, together they are terrific.",1,41
"7/12/99 review unfair; a quite useful book: the only other review at the time of this posting is rather unfair, probably because the author misunderstood the purpose of the book. it is a guide for walking the streets of paris to look at buildings. it is not a coffee-table book. hence the relative paucity of illustrations. hence the use of actual french names for buildings and places. (how else would you find them? the signs are not in english. and the reviewer obviously found translation no problem.) and the maps are certainly adequate for finding your way. they show excellent small-scale detail. perhaps the only ""fault"" of the book is that it is so compendious and the information so complete that it takes some study to plan your day. but at 446 pgs, it still fits neatly in a handbag or camera pack. the index is very good, and there are 20 blank pages at the back for your personal notes.",1,161
"i can't put it down.: there are very few books that i have a hard time putting down, but james patterson's books never fail. this latest foray into the life of det. alex cross is one that kept me up reading late into the night and upset when i was finished too quickly. a great story and one that i enjoyed reading and figuring out. i can not wait for the next installment.",1,73
"nice organizational product!: this item is a great addition for our movie collection....we have alot and want them to take up less space than traditional dvd cases. nice product, stury, and attractive in any decor.",1,35
interesting & usefull: small & quite handy book. usefull when one's in doubt about the color range. i can recommand it to anyone.,1,23
"god's kingdom: the kingdom focused church: a complelling image of an achievable future for your church is a awesome book for a pastor who wants to have a kingdom focused church and be in congruent with the congregation of his church. gene mims outlined the procedure cleverly on how to proceed in organizing an effective church today. how to focus on the combination make up of the congregation or audience. for example, young, old, educated, uneducated, layperson, clergyman, evangelist, prophet (tess), etc. to know what jargon to use and identify his audience to communicate the message with confidence. kingdom living is a requirement in order to be effective in god's churches today. amazon allowed me to view the book before i purchased it, very thankful for the prerequisite view before purchasing. my professor expressed my choice of literature to summate are excellent, thanks to amazon! consider the purchase of this book a must!evangelist m. simmons",1,155
"early efforts from an overlooked singer: this is a great addition to any collection of jazz and popular vocals. i got to see maxine sullivan during the second phase of her career, when she came back after working and raising her children to thrill those of us who weren't around for phase 1. the lady loved good music and presented it well. ""loch lomond"" and the other classics from her early career were not among my favorites. but even in the 1930s and '40s, maxine made memorable recordings of ballads like ""easy to love,"" ""spring is here,"" ""ill wind,"" ""when your lover has gone,"" ""ev'ry time we say goodbye"" and others. her later recordings for the concord, audiophile, atlantic, baldwin street, kenneth and drg labels were better than some of these early efforts, but this four-cd set shows you how it all began. it's nice to see this recognition for maxine 20 years after cancer claimed her life.",1,158
"so long astoria, this cd is a buried treasure: this cd starts off strong with the song ""so long, astoria,"" and never loses the pace. with other hits like ""in this diary,"" ""my reply,"" ""the saddest song,"" and ""the boys of summer,"" this cd is bound to be a hit.",1,50
excellent devotional book: the thoughts each day seem to apply to that day's circumstanes. i began reading a few months after my husband's sudden death. this book has been strengthening to me emotionally and spiritually.,1,35
requirement: my son got accepted to the high school of engineering and science. so this is a must have for the next four years. i decided on the se version over the standard as it has a faster processor (which is not a deal breaker) but the additional memory for storage is what makes this a better buy over the standard.,1,61
"yes, this rotor is built ford tough...: ...but only for use on the 4x4 version of the f-150. if your truck is 4x2, then you'll need to purchase the motorcraft brr143 and a new spindle nut and cotter pin. the 4x4 and 4x2 have differently made front rotors.",1,48
"corn silk facial powder: love, love, love this product. does not clog pores. it has a fine finish that provides perfect coverage. the corn powder soaks up oil leaving skin flawless looking. a real hard to find item. i only found it here. it does not make your make up looking caked on. colors match perfectly. great for oily skin and any skin with imperfections. you cannot beat the price either.",1,71
"for those who have a devotion to the sacred heart of jesus: this little book is a treasure of inspiring quotes, lessons and teachings for those who wish to grow in love and devotion to the sacred heart. st. gertrude is taught by the great teacher and shares what she has learned from him. i have learned much and been unable to put it down. it is beautiful. i recommend it to any christian who loves jesus and wants to grow in that love and devotion.",1,86
"untouchables: i had been waiting for this record an eternity and i rushed to buy it the very morning it was published. the first time i listened to it, i was very disappointed. all of the songs seemed to sound the same as the previous ones. but as i listened to it more and more i noticed how good it really is. you have to give it a few listens before you can get into it. this certainly isn't anything like issues or follow the leader, it's more like their first album (except this time around they know what they're doing). there are many hard, heavy and melodic songs like embrace and bottled up inside, and almost every track has beautiful melody over the chorus. there are still a couple of tracks that i do not like (make believe, beat it upright & wake up hate), for they lack the melody that makes this cd good. i just think this is by far the best album korn has made, but the most hard to get into.",1,176
"well worth the cost: i bought this for my daughter and grandson. they live by the beach and she puts all her beach ""stuff"" in the wagon including her son, joey, and wheels it to where they will sit on the sand. she says the wagon wheels are great on the sand and joey loves the ride.radio flyer all-terrain cargo wagon",1,61
"westerns: this was a very good movie showing descrimination against indians. audie murphy as cash was a perfect example of hatred for indians, even though she had been raised his adopted sister,during the time depicted. burt was burt (great) as well as hepburn (awsome).",1,44
"tootsie - 25th anniversary edition: michael dorsey is an unemployed actor with an impossible reputation. in order to find work and fund his friend's play he dresses as a woman, dorothy michaels, and lands the part in a daytime drama. dorsey loses himself in this woman role and essentially becomes dorothy michaels, captivating women all around the city and inspiring them to break free from the control of men and become more like dorsey's initial identity. this newfound role, however, lands dorsey in a hot spot between a female friend/lover, a female co-star he falls in love with, that co-star's father who falls in love with him, and a male co-star who yearns for his affection. dustin hoffman is pure genius in this movie. ""tootsie"" is a small masterpiece of intelligent comedy, full of emotions, love and interesting observations about the relationship between women and men.",1,146
"a departure for mason that remains intriguing: the first time i listened to this record i was baffled over mason's choice of subjects and use of loose, reggae- and jazz-flavored rhythms. but after a while, the heartfelt nature with which he paid tribute to dr. king, the barely-boiling-over anger of global empire, the ode to true love in ballad for my one true love and the sighing loss of train leaving gray seemed to pinpoint not only the struggles that mason seemed to be facing as a songwriter but the same struggles that most of humanity faces in one form or another.",1,102
"dvd please: this movie, the last unicorn and the phantom tollbooth were my favorite movies as a child. only one is out on dvd. unfortunately it's not this one. i know the company is making a killing on the last unicorn. this one would very easily match it. if the dvd gods are reading this please, please, please put it out on dvd! i promise to buy at least 3 copies.",1,71
"100% megaman !: i am a big fan of megaman..if you like megaman i know you are going to buy this game regardless..so i will cut it short..this is the best megaman 2-d to date the graphics and gameplay are out of sight..the music is not bad and has some great cartoon pics..i only have one little negative. > i just cant stand listening to that beeping sound that takes place during the talking sequence..i would rather have a mute than hear that beeping..so anyway i do, just mute it.. but the game kicks man lets give it up...too awesome !!",1,101
"house: i absolutely loved this book i couldn't put it down, its 372 pages and i read it in two days,it always kept me on my toes, and wanting more, although i thought the description of white was very typical, the only interesting thing about his features was a tin mask, and well lets face it the mask is a little played out in the horror stories, other than that it was an awesome book, and i recomend any one who likes horror stories of evil versus good to read it.",1,91
"no plastic flavor: compared to other brands these seem to leach very little plastic flavor into water even after long hot days on the trail.i have never had one leak, though a new bite valve was needed as the frist one had leaks where my teeth had bitten through it after over five years of regular use!a touch disappointed that the 2l is simply slimmer but just as tall as the 3l.overall great water bag, evenif the handle part system is pretty poinntless and ended up on the trash.",1,89
best tea!!!: the is my husband preferred tea and he has been drinking it for many years now. this product was shipped promptly.,1,23
"finally found sugar daddys: my sister has celiac disease and can only eat certain gluten-free foods...luckily, sugar daddys are perfect & hershey's milk chocolae bars are just a couple of the only candy bars she can have. she was so thrilled to get a box of sugar daddys for christmas she said that's all she wants for her birthday. sooo, that's what she's getting!!! she likes the smaller ones..daddy pops!",1,70
great dance music: i was glad to find this cd. it has a good mix of dance music. the songs are classic dance.,1,23
"excellent movie: great character interaction. teams always storm when they are forming, and these guys end up performing at a high level. my favorite part has to be the hulk schooling loki. makes me laugh every time i see it.",1,40
"love it!: great item! the only thing is if you have taller froasted cupcakes, they tend to tip. otherwise easy to set up and looks great!",1,26
"detailed eco designs aimed at the diyer: this could be considered a permaculture approach to building your own house, covers almost everything you would need to know to replicate a similar, cost and ""eco"" effective housing, down to plumbing and plastering tutorials. this is by no means a comprehensive directory of all the available ""eco"" materials, but focuses on his thorough hands-on construction that is locally appropriate (montana) like slip-form stonework and log-cabin, plus decent coverage of diy masonry stove and a methane digester.well written without too much narrative or technical analysis. similar in value to rob roy's earth-sheltered houses",1,100
gripping book: excellent read ... kept my interest and intrigue. sometimes explainations of the technical and scientific data went over my head ... but not a detraction from the story in any way. played political games into story in a very realistic and dramatic way.,1,45
"3.5 stars for me:): good cd ...the mix is not the best(other wise it'd be 4 stars)..would like the guitars to be ""crunched up"" and brought more to the front.but all in all it's a good disc...my personal favorites are new discovery,innocence lost,endless days,call of the wild and hearts are broken:)",1,51
"surprisingly good: i really enjoyed this book. i was craving to get away from the 'innocent virgin' genre and this fit the bill.i liked the chemistry between the protagonists, hate at first sight is a big 'yawn' but this was written in a tolerable way. if you are looking for stephanie laurens type bedroom scnese, don't hold your breath as this book is surprisingly conservative in that vein.the main characters were credible, the supporting characters i also liked and they are more fleshed out than in most books. all in all a great diversion for a saturday afternoon when you are sick in bed.",1,104
absolutely perfect!: product arrived within estimated delivery time. product was concealed within its own packaging but also in a padded cardboard box. now has been installed and has improved air flow in my 2002 tf rodeo. satisfied customer!,1,38
very interesting story: i didn't remember reading this in school so i thought i'd give a try. it was free with my kindle app. i thoroughly enjoyed it. a very sweet story that had you hoping for a happy ending.,1,40
"great bargain: i received a gold box offer for this item and only had to pay $$! what a bargain! i figured that if it wasn't really great, i wouldn't loose much. was i surprised? yes, the chef's knife is especially my favorite. it cuts with such ease. glad i took the chance on this bargain!",1,56
"finally!: after two failed purchases from amazon sellers, i opted to get this battery from amazon directly and i got it promptly.thanks amazon",1,23
"insightful look at today's politics: i've always been a fan of sean hannity from listening to him on the radio, and his book, ""let freedom ring,"" just enforces my good thoughts on the guy. he speaks sensibly and is sure not to sound too arrogant, while at the same time, powerfully asserting his political beliefs. i don't know how he does it.thanks, sean!",1,63
love this movie!: this is one of the most inspirational movies out there. based on a true story about a young man who has to overcome serious hardships under some of the toughest conditions. once you are done watching you will want to go out a do something! must watch.,1,50
"so much fun: my 15 month old daughter loves her buggy! we take it everywhere we go, to the park, the mall, or just around the block for walks. she gets alot of attention (which she loves) and she has fun honking the horn. i love this buggy!",1,48
"all things...: on the back of the paperback edition of the once and future king there is a description that says, ""it is the book of all things lost and wonderful and sad,"" what a beautiful, perfect way to describe the book. although i am a neophyte at fantasy and arthurian literature, this was one of the finest pieces of writing i have ever come across. it is similar, especially in the first book, the sword and the stone, to the orwell animal farm in that it is simple, if you choose to look at it that way, but can be enjoyed on several levels. the best thing about white's writing is that nothing is simple and everything is simple. read it and see",1,124
"relaxation: this cd is the ultimate lounge cd. just lean back, kick up your heals and let the music do the talkin'.",1,22
"excellent information, so-so presentation: greg palast is the well-known investigative journalist for the uk guardian. in ""the best democracy money can buy,"" he skewers politicians and corporations with documents, interviews, and carefully conducted research. greg walks you through the various investigations step-by-step; exposing the dirty secrets kept by people whose names you will instantly recognize--names like bush, blair, robertson, lay, etc. it is a disturbing journey into the dark world of politics and greed, and it should be required reading for anyone who is interested in current events.if you know someone who is always reading a newspaper, ""the best democracy money can buy"" would make an excellent gift.",1,108
great help book: this is a great book to help people learn to talk to each other so we can understand each other.,1,23
"sweet: got this collection for nostalgic reasons. grew up with these songs. as my wife pointed out these songs are meaningless, i guess thats why they aren't offensive. i enjoyed them as a kid and i had fun listening and dancing to the tunes.its a good collection.",1,47
"simple but delightful.: after seeing this sweet little film, i wanted to make my own movies. more to the point, i wanted to run right out and buy my own movie camera and be a cinematographer. i am a still photographer (25 years), but after viewing ""green papaya,"" i wondered why i hadn't been into film making before. a very simple story, a little vietnamese girl with an irresistable grin, views the world closely, passionately. suddenly she ten years older, and finds herself the maiden to the same young man she had a crush on as a little girl.",1,99
"great music: even those of you who haven't seen the movie will like this cd. the music alternates from slow and soothing to heavy drum-based action excitement. loreena mckennitt has a voice to make you cry, and wonder if such a voice could possibly be human. truely amazing! a great buy!",1,51
track listing: tracks:1. di bolina2. nel bene e nel male3. cio' che ci resta4. sul confine5. cose che dimentico6. tracce7. notti di genova8. l'era dell'oro9. la notte di san loren,1,30
"great cd (and easy to play): this is a great cd, and was extremely easy to play. i don't know what all these other reviewers (if it is indeed more than one reviewer) are talking about. it easily played on both my stereo at home and my car cd player.",1,50
"this is the complete theatrical cut, it's not a cut version, people!: the two comments about this being a cut version are misleading. this is the complete theatrical version as released at 238 minutes. there were various cut versions that the producers released without the director's approval, but this is not one of them. it's the version visconti sanctioned to be released at the time. to speak of the only version worthy of release as being a 6 hour version is certainly a bit extreme. would you refer to the approved theatrical release of bergman's fanny and alexander as cut?",1,100
"for those who like to go further: for anyone unfamiliar with the jazz-rock trio, give could be a poor starting point next to their textbook debut dazzler. yet i am surprised by some fans and critics who dismissed the harder-pushing sophomore major as a primarily atonal indulgence. for sure the disc pushes a little too stubbornly at times, building showy heaps of cryptic melody and time signatures into epic posturing without the slightest hesitation- but for every masturbatory musical off-ramp we are privy to, the boys flaunt double in the way of sheer triumphant virtuoso synergy. listen, and listen again.",1,100
"the refined playing!: as we know, arturo benedetti achieved his own sound, a sort of personal landmark that only very distinguished seal that just a few pianist along the history have been capable to develop.this successful collaboration with the legendary baton of giulni conferred this mozart `s performances of vigorous vitality and notable refinement. it will be very hard for us to listen such level of vision in the new generations to come.that's why i recommend it plainly.",1,78
"a wedding book with heart: this book gives so many fresh ideas on how to simplify and keep wedding costs down, while making the big day so much more personal and intimate. by increasing the involvement of your friends and family in all aspects of the celebration, something occurs that is ""missing in more elaborate weddings ... an overwhelming sense of love, joy and community"". that is the heart of this book, and what makes it unique - well worth reading.",1,81
it works well: i can say worked well for what i wanted. it connects to my tv and lap top. i also have it on my computer.,1,27
art asylum has done it again!: art asylum toys are exceptional in their detail---a welcome entry in the star trek franchise after years of cookie cutter figures and fun but not so intricately detailed ships from other vendors. you'll love the detail on this or any other art asylum star trek ship. i hope they make voyager and ds9 too! these toys are great for collecting and i'm sure kids will love to play with them (but probably not great for small children). their educational value is in the eye opening star trek universe---once you get involved in the storytelling (indirectly perhaps through the toys) you can't help but see the educational value. much better than most tv onscreen these days.,1,121

"phish's ""american beauty"": many of the reviewers have not failed to mention that phish is best experienced ""live"". however, it is pertinent to mention that the band's latest disc, ""farmhouse"" is comparable to the dead's ""american beauty"" album, in that the songs are short, well consise, beautifully played, and, might i mention, extremely catchy. hopefully, more music aficionados will catch on to phish because of this more accessible format. i, myself, am finally starting to appreciate the longer jams, i.e. tweezer, that have been captured on the band's live cd's (""a live one"") or on tape. on that note, thanks trey, mike, page, and fishman for a great disc.",1,109
"fascinating and scary - life changing info: this book and the studies within are a hugely needed wakeup call for our society. we changed our diet last year to a mostly plant based diet and i cannot even begin to tell you all the amazing benefits we've seen thus far. additionally, my mother in law works in a hospital who has recently implemented the chip program, which was also founded by the author of this book. a very smart man trying his hardest to honestly change this country's horrible eating habits. this book was just one of many that contributed to our family's nutritional education. highly recommended for anyone who puts food in their mouths, especially mothers responsible for feeding children.",1,121
cat-aerobics! :): this cat toy is fantastic! i don't think there is a single cat out there that can resist it. my two cats lunged at it in about two seconds as soon as i gave the ball a little shove to get their attention. they played with it together for about ten minutes straight and it was so amusing to watch them really get all energized over this toy jumping and slapping the ball to each other. they come play with it every time i pull it from the corner of the room.the cat scratcher middle is fantastic as well. i don't have a scratching post so when ever they start getting frisky and clawing my upholstered chairs i just slide out the scratcher and they immediately use that instead! fantastic toy ...buy one for yourself and any friends who may have a sweet feline!i've had mine since august 2010 and im now on to the second side of the scratching card in case you're wondering if to get extras. you'll have some happy cats with this one!,1,179
"one of the best games i've ever played!: when i got this game, i really didn't know what it was, but after playing it for about 15 minutes, i was hooked! this game might be old, but it's very addictive. no matter how good the graphics are in a game, the most important factor is the overall gameplay. and harvest moon's gameplay is awsome!",1,64
"innovative to say the least: picture yourself back in 1989. you are in a music store thumbing through the ""n's"" you come across this particular cd and think to yourself, ""who are these guys?, nine inch what?, pretty hate what? i don't think so..next!!"". you probably weren't alone. it amazes me that this album is this old. if you put it into context with other releases from artists of the era will you realize that this album was released before ""violator"" - depeche mode, just four months after ""disinigration"" - cure. it's really a tribute to how innovative this album is musically. this is truly a must have for music fans everywhere. i mean, how can you not own this album? the keyboards riffs are just great as for the synthesizers. this is my favorite nin album. i think that's a consensus with many of the other reviewers. if you only buy one nin make it this one. it's well worth it.",1,162
"all the foundations of how to re-define looks and style to achieve maximum results: if the duo authors trinny woodall and susannah constantine look familiar on the jacket of what you wear can change your life, that's because you've probably seen them on tv, hosting bbc series shows of surprise fashion makeovers for their chosen targets. here's a follow-up to their prior two fashion guides, and a supplement to the idea of a fashion makeover which advocates that fashion choices can change one's life. chapters cover all the foundations of how to re-define looks and style to achieve maximum results and get down to the basics of what to wear.",1,110
"sky captain is beyond belief: sky captain and the world of tomorrow - this is a great movie. it is beautifully filmed and has a plot that will remind you of all those classic adventure stories plus sci-fi greats like flash gordon and buck rogers. the movie was almost 100 percent cgi, but it doesn't take away from the movie at all. jude law is great at playing the epic larger than life hero who is never beaten no matter what the odds. the gadgets are fun, and the robots are cool in a retro yet futuristic kind of way. i highly recommend this movie!!!",1,105
"love it!: ""dance"" is keller's remix of laugh. the bass really sticks out on this album which i love. if you already are a fan of ""laugh"" or have seen him live i would definitely pick this one up. some goodies include ""tweeker"", ""yeah"", and ""barker"". definitely reminds of the dance portions he works into his sets. enjoy!",1,58
"not better than game: seeing as i loved ender's game, i bought speaker for the dead its sequel. let's just say i was confused to high heavens in the first few chapters. first off, all these new characters came and i must have reread chapters one and two about five times before moving onward. another thing was the major changes between this book and ender's game.however i took my time and reread each chapter and finally got a firm grip on the story and continued reading. i found the beginning somewhat boring but in the middle and end were great. i found once ender got to lusitania the story picked up greatly. good read and i recommend it, four starts.",1,120

"friedman is compulsary reading in these troubled times: thomas friedman has become compulsary reading in these troubled times - for us in europe, thankfully in the international herald tribune. and for those who find that the new york times is not to their taste - read and enjoy this book. for example, although an ny times columnist, he was in favour of the war with iraq! so liberals, conservatives, visiting brits from overseas (like me): read him weekly and then buy this book! chrisotpher catherwood, author of christians, muslims and islamic rage (zondervan, 2003)",1,94
does the job!!: i tried this straightening iron at a friend's house and could not believe how straight my hair could be! i've tried other straighteners but this one is great because it has 4 different heat settings which is great for all different hair types. it heats up quickly and straightens in half the time it took me with other straighteners.,1,62

"solomon has done it again!! bravo from philly!!!!: the bridge is like pipe dreams to the tenth power. although it is a completely different story, solomon has a way of grabbing you by the hand and walking you through a world unlike your own. both books kept your attention with the right-in-your-face action which made the book a definite page turner. i immediately felt the pain of the characters, and what emotions they were going through without being side tracked from the story. the ending was a true shocker and it will have even the most avid reader stunned. solomon jones is bringing something to the table that the average reader isn&#65533;t quite ready for. writers beware; there is a new man on the block, and he&#65533;s about to take us by storm. bravo, solomon! if you haven&#65533;t read a good book this year you will not be disappointed with the bridge.reviewed by anna forrest of asthepageturns book club",1,159
"this is the best book that i have read by the beatles!: i have read a lot of beatles books, and i thought that this was the greatest book on them. it is just so much better to actually read the beatles own words on each other, drugs, and music. this book was well edited and i am still able to read it over and over again. i would recommed this book toanyone who has any interest in the beatles or who really wants to read a terrific book on the best band ever.",1,94

"nice book but nothing dotty about it: my son really likes this book and painted a bunch of trucks with the do-a-dot markers when i gave it to him today. but it should be noted that it really is just a coloring book like any other. there is nothing particular about it in terms of dots or circles to color with the markers. the paper is nice and thick, but we also used our do-a-dot markers on some regular paper and they worked fine.",1,84

"power out and you're in the dark?: i run a bed and breakfast and needed power out lights for my insurance. i plugged these in all the rooms and forgot about them. then the power went out. we live in a remote town and it is dark. having the light come on is reassuring. they didn't last very long, about an hour, but good enough to get you set up with candles. we also have cranking flashlights which is good, our power was out for 4 days.",1,87
"60 years old but still a gem: this book celebrates its 60th birthday this year but it's difficult to top it for the most straightforward, comprehensive overview of the curriculum process. there are few curriculum writers or decision makers that don't follow the methods advocated by tyler, in part if not in whole. the style is clear and easy to read, and furthermore, as one reads through, one realises that tyler was advocating other developments like outcomes and standards years before they became (in)famous and incorporated in edu-speak. the best modern book on curriculum is by john biggs (""teaching for quality learning at university"") and he pays tribute to the influence of tyler's book on his own work. unfortunately tyler's is one of those books that everyone has read about but few have actually read. do read it - it has pearls of wisdoms for today's educationalists or for anyone interested in schools and what they do, and it is only 128 pages long!",1,164

"what can i say?: for anyone who has ever wondered what shakespeare would be writing, were he alive today; look no further than the films of kevin smith. whitty dialogue, intricate story lines, characters with depth, and baudy humor (to satisfy the rabble in the pit; we smell our own)are the hallmark of his films. this film, the first of what fans have dubbed 'the jersey trilogy', is a decent debut for smith, but the movie drags ever-so-slightly in the middle. it is, however, by no means is a disappointment. the new dvd release comes packed with features and is a ""must have"" for the hardcore fan.",1,107

(any time we operated the old microwave when the baby slept, she would hear it and and wake up screaming thinking it was time for a bottle.) this one is working out great. love the function keys that allow you to turn the button volume off. only thing i do not like about the microwave is the spring sound the door makes when it opens and closes. (my last microwave had the handle on the door which allowed you to close it more quietly.) as far as cooking goes, it also works great. i absolutely love the sensor reheat button. it rewarms food perfectly.",1,126

"hilarious!: so many clever references in this show. i love how each historical figure translated into a typical high school persona, but with a twist. it's when you spot cariactures of the ratpack or hear about jfk sleeping with ""catherine-the-not-so-great"" that i get the giggles and end up watching another episode when i thought i could just watch one.",1,59
"loved it! loved it! loved it!: this book was incredible. i am a very picky reader and usually buy books written by a select few, eg., walter mosley, omar tyree or dianne mckinney-whetstone. however, i am always on the look-out for new authors to add to my collection. nina corbett hit the nail on the head with this book. i really enjoyed the story because it felt like i was sharing and listening with two of my good friends. ms. corbett's unique way of telling a story allowed me to express some sort of emotion at each chapter--whether it was laughter, sadness or utter ""hands on my hips"" disbelief.i also enjoyed the way the title and the chapters related to well known songs. ms. corbett also impressed me with the list of questions at the back of the book. it made me want to start my own book club just so that i could share this book with others!!!""standing in the shadows of love"" is a real page turner and has a story that every woman can relate to. i look forward to ms. corbett's next novel.",1,187

"a great read, moving and informative: this is an excellent book. it shows readers a better alternative to so-called forced busing which got its worse name in the city of boston. but this book is about a voluntary program that let black kids go to suburbia. the writer really lets the former students talk for themselves and because of that it is a really moving book that feels honest and real. when the writer does comment on things, it is always very graceful and plainly spoken. this book does not try to be overly academic, and so is a welcome treat to read. i wish there were more 'human' books out there about subjects like this, which are usually written in very dull, dry styles.",1,125

"easily modded. nice unit.: this sam sp01 can be easily modded for use with the oktava mk319. i found instructions through a google search. the metal piece on the bottom of the mic holder must be removed. instead of hammering it out, i used two screwdrivers to pry it out. that leaves a nice hole which is just a little too small to use. using my dremel tool, i was able to enlarge the hole just a bit. as a guide the piece you remove fits in a small groove. you must file down the sides til the groove is almost not visible. then your oktava will fit just fine. this mod is not easily reversible so keep that in mind before starting. i'll post up a picture later.i found the screw-on connector to not be that high quality. it wanted to cross thread as i putting it on my mic stand. so i wouldn't want to be taking it off and putting it back on frequently. that's my only complaint about it.",1,173

"an enjoyable look back at the dawn of the jet age: skyliners takes us across north america, from sea to shining sea, and presents the dawn of the jet age in all its glory. each stop offers an amazing variety of late piston and turboprop and early jet passenger aircraft, ranging from the familiar boeing 707 and dc-8 to more obscure birds. those of us who had the good fortune to have witnessed this interesting era in civil aviation will remember with great fondness those united jet mailiners, eastern golden falcon jets, and delta and american airlines flagships and astrojets.the photos are generally of good quality and well reproduced. the short captions are entertaining, even if they do not have a great deal of substance. what makes this book worth the money is that it offers a seldom seen glimpse to the late 1950s and early 1960s, one rarely seen in such a high-quality format.",1,155

"eva-dry edv-e-500: i purchased this product on 8/1/08 and on 9/8/08 i plugged it in for the renewable feature. it is more than i expected from a wireless, stand alone product. i use one in each of my walk-in closets and they seem to have taken care of the humidity problem and resulting mold on shoes, etc.as i said, this product lasted for five weeks before i had to 'recharge' it and i am most happy with its performance.",1,79
"good idea but...: i bought this for extra storage space in the attic. they arrived quickly without a scratch. a six pack does not cover that much space however. for the price it was easier and cheaper to put down some plywood giving me more space to walk and store stuff. also, be certain that the studs are 16 inches... in typical wall construction studs are placed 16 inches on center, it is also typical that depending on your roof/ceiling type that the floor studs are not always 16 inches apart.",1,91
"truly delightful once you get past the whole dead kittens thing.: i'm not sure i can add anything that hasn't already been said. my only real criticism of the book was that i found the very ending (we're talking literally the last chapter, not the climax which i loved) to be a touch predictable. really there was only one of two ways it could go, so i suppose that was unavoidable. but, that being said, the journey to that point was unbelievably delightful (again, dead kittens aside). the writing was stellar, as you would expect from gaiman, and the story was quite original. it's like he mashed up the wizard of oz and alice in wonderland, put it underneath modern day london, and threw it all in the middle of a particularly gory slasher movie. i absolutely loved it and it made me just want to buy all of his other books and read them too. so well done, sir. well done indeed.",1,163
"great romance!: when tanner davenport flew his cessna from alaska and had to do an emergency landing in mckay land he was not ready for charity mckay to be so... charity! he has been gone for seven years but he could remember that fiery red hair anywhere. he thought his younger brother needed rescuing and that's what he came to do. kentucky brought back a lot of memories, good and bad ones, but he couldn't fight the new sparks flying everywhere when charity was around. he knew he couldn't stay and charity's life was here at the ranch. her life was horses and his the airplanes. but a common goal might help them to fight the attraction between them rescuing their families from making a life altering mistake. dianne's stories once again tug at the fibers of the heart. a story about loyalties and friendship, coming together to turn into a fun sexy romance. this is a great story about love and ties that bound the hearts of a family and friends together.",1,173
"necklace: the beads are a bit smaller than i expected, but i am very impressed with the quality-excellent buy!",1,19
harry potter and deathly hallows: this is a good movie and amazon delivered as promised. highly recommended if you are a fan of the series.,1,25
"movie: this movie i purchased for a class. even though it was in subtitles, i was able to follow the story. the movies were in excellent shape, played great and i will be giving them to my professor to use in future classes",1,43
thanks again vickie: just as wonderful as vickie's pregnancy book. a must have for the first few weeks back from the hospital when you're unsure of everything. thanks again vickie.,1,30
first mp3 player: this is the first mp3 player i have used/purchased. i am very happy with it. i love the size of it and it holds enough music for my needs. the software that it comes with has been easy to work with. i find it takes a while to convert wav files to mp3 or wma files but that is fine. but it does not take long to gt the mp3 files on the player.this is a good player with not to many extras youcan adjust the bass and treb and it has repet and random but that is about it. but if you dont care about a lot of frills this mp3 player is for you!,1,119
"decking review: excellent book for the home diy person. if you thinking of hiring contractors to put in a deck, forget it, buy this book and diy.",1,27
"best nail clippers: my baby is 10 weeks old and i can honestly say i've only used the nail clippers so far. they are wonderful though, as i have two other brands and can't use either of them. i'm sure i'll get more use out of the other stuff as my baby gets older though. i also bought an ""especially for baby"" kit that was very similar to this one just to keep in her diaper bag because it was cheaper, but definitely spend the extra to get this one. the nail clippers in the other one are useless.",1,99
"a great album and also an awesome reflection of the 70's!: the first time i heard it was when i was 11,my dad had an old lp and i loved it.agreat addition to any collection if you like grateful dead type country-rock. the song henry is a great reflection of early 70's marijauna laced lifestyle,and glendale train tells a wonderful story.",1,61
i liked it: the book was in good condition. i ordered the wrong book but decided to keep the handbook that went with the book.,1,25
"the reason to buy a gamecube.: this is the best game ever! if i could, i would give it 100 stars. there is so much to do, it will keep you up of hours. it is so addictive. it is 5 times better than the 64 version. so many characters, levels, and things to do. so if you really want this game, stop reading this review and buy it!",1,69
"love is chemicals gets the whole indie thing: i am not one to purchase an album on itunes or amazon to put it plainly- buy any music whatsoever. in fact, the thought has never crossed my mind in this day of the all encompassing torrent.until that is, today when my pandora station (the shins) played ""everyone is in on it"" by the love is chemicals.it took me all but 2 minutes to buy the album and load it on my iphone. the orchestration is tight with the vocals lightly floating above a talent which , i am surprised to see has not broken out on most indie stations or blogs.this album has passed the ""i like more than 3 songs test..""buy it!",1,122
multi-platinum pro tools: excellent techniques and well explained. these techniques have improved my music production abilities right away. i do recommend this book to anyone.,1,25
"nice beginning: i watched the first chapter of trinity blood and i loved it. the first chapter introduces you to the characters and storyline. each episode tells a different story. it is also full of mystery since the main story is not revealed yet as part of the suspense. the drawings are fantastic and the characters are wonderful.you get to know the mysterious father nightroad a bit and then sister esther, then you relate them to the ending song which excites you to watch the rest of the series and learn more. in general, it is a nice beginning.",1,99
"very very good: this dvd set is great. i have watched all 3 disks over and over again because i just can't get enough of it. my favorite matches were batista vs hhh, john cena vs jbl and the the undertaker vs rany orten. another thing that i liked was disk 3. it is all about the 2005 hall of fame.",1,61
"covers the range of their musical journey. worth owning if yer a fan.: peel songs can be something or not. the undertones were one of those bands who pretty much recreated their songs in the peel studios live like they sounded on their records. i've heard several live undertones shows and they really got into it. actually, i sent like 12 friends and relatives to see their san diego show in like 1980 and i was workin' that evening. bummer.so, yeah, these peel songs are nice but not crucial. yer not gonna hear great variations on the studio versions here. a big undertones fan should definitely get them cuz, well, cuz it's more undertones, in theory. otherwise, i'd stick with their studio albums.i always wanna hear peel sets by the bands i really like to see if there's variations on some of their great songs. you don't really find that here. slits did a cool peel set. heck, there's gobs of bands who played it over the decades. i'm just glad they've released a bunch of 'em. chrisbct@hotmail.com",1,178
derek jeter is number i: this was a great book on derek jeters accomplishments dreams and just everything you will need and want to know about derek jeter> i really like the quote that is used i think by his parents: you can't change what happenes:) so if you like derek jeter you will love this book,1,57
"top of the list for using imagery: i'm biased. i took imagery training with marty rossman some years ago and found him down to earth, honest and real, as well as one exceptional practitioner of therapeutic imagery. he writes well too. i came in primed to appreciate his work as i had developed my practice from some of the same sources as rossman and found that he had done an excellent job of integrating a number of useful techniques and placing them in a good technical context.i have seen clients of mine use the techniques in this book to alter the course of chronic and painful conditions. i have had personal success using these techniques, too. for the years i was teaching imagery workshops, this was the textbook i used. it generally got excellent feedback from the workshop participants.",1,139
"top-notch hard science fiction: kevin anderson and doug beason expertly take us into the depth of virtual reality. the story is a gripping tale of how technology can go wrong. agent kreident, the main character, is a computer savy fbi agent who specializes in high tech cases. he teams up with the young paige mitchell who helps spice up the plot a bit with undertones of innocent sexuality. this reviewer did find the paige mitchell character's usuage of the term, ""kay-o"" (ie: okay), to be a bit annoying and over used. overall, i'd rate the book as a great read, however.",1,101
great games: this game was fun. it was a long game it also gives you all the levels form airline tycoon. i would recomend buying it.,1,26
"really good flute!: i have several very expensive handmade wooden native american flutes. i find that the sound quality of this flute is comparable, and having a flute that you don't have to worry so much about is great! the tone is very consistent, and the flute is quite playable. since it is a six-hole flute it is much more versitile than the 5-hole versions offered by many manufacturers.",1,69
"cool country.: i was late to the uncle tupelo party, even though i lived around st. louis at the time. much like gram parsons before, uncle tupelo seem to have gotten more recognition after the fact than they did while together. both artists are credited with pioneering this so called alt-country scene, though ""ut"" include elements of punk as well. this anthology of theirs may be imperfect, but it's still the perfect place to start your collection of the group or genre. included is ""no depression"", ""whisky bottle"", ""moonshiner"", and a live ""we've been had"". plus a decent cover of the stooges ""i wanna be your dog"". at 21 tracks, this disc is a good example of quantity, as well as quality. if you like this, you might also like wilco, son volt or the jayhawks.",1,136
"foreigner fans, never mind the bad reviews, get this dvd: most of you people should probably get a new tv, dvd player and sound system.... this dvd is very enjoyable !!! there are no problems with the audio or the video on this dvd. yes some of the stuff might be a bit cheezy, but that's how dvd's from the early 90's look like. i think the worst thing on this dvd is the stage design. but nothing we can do about that.....and to the person who collects and owns 35 dvd's...well you're not in a position to criticize any dvd. when you get to the major leagues of collecting dvd's and have at least 500 and up, you can comment !!! what a joke this is !!!",1,128
peggys review: peggy britt is awesome. she's so cool. i wish i was her. i am her grandson but i like it anyway. it is a very good album.,1,29
"this book will make your mouth water and your belly growl: this is a wonderful book about eating in the south, eating out and eating in, about a whole host of things like family and fellowship that gather around any groaning board in the south, and what you want to eat where and what the people who live there eat, how to cook it and where you're likely to find it at a reasonable price made by food-loving hands. john egerton clearly ate his way across the south to write this book, and he was careful to stay well off the beaten path. it's anthropology, sociology, recipes, culture and good humor, from the north carolina mountains to the swamps of cajun country. this book will make your mouth water and your belly growl, but most of all it's a fine read.",1,141
"good rock metal album by a good band who can pull off both sounds: korn's untouchables has been giving mixed reviews over the years. i personally enjoy 11 out of the 15 songs on it, the cd says 14 but their is the bonus remix song of here to stay as track 15. they comined a musical sound of both metal and rock music into the same cd. i actually enjoy this new cd of their's because of the lryics in the songs hollow life, thoughtless, alone i break, and no one's there. i didn't care for track 2 make believe, track 3 blame, track 5 bottled up inside, and track 10 embrace. but if your looking for a good mixture of music both lryically and for the music then this rock metal cd will be great for you to enjoy time and time again. just keep an open mind and ear to the music on this cd and see how many songs you end up liking out of the whole cd.",1,172
"best of the best ( says it all ): the only thing that might top it is ""message in a bottle"" just finished it and loved it too! wish more writers could write like this but i haven't found one yet!!! sparks catches you from the very beginning and just pulls you in from there on out until the end, which leaves you feeling awesome can't find the words to describe the feeling! you'll just have to read both and find out for yourself!!!!!",1,84
"a universal language for the heart: i came across this book by ""accident"" a few months ago.it has to be the most beautiful description of god, truth, dhamma, that i have ever read. love, compassion and selflessness,are the perfume on each and every page.a truly heart reaching book.",1,48
"smitten, still...: like many, i remain smitten by the story, the movie and the original soundtrack. this ""differnt"" rendition fills that gap wanting an extension to the instrumental portions of the original.",1,32
decent sountrack: i bought this for the one song where lowe and spader are robbing the liquor store...very cool. there are a couple other good songs too.,1,27
"excellent book for boxer owners: it is an excellent book for boxer owners. simple, fun, full of usefull tips and information for both the owner and the dog.good artistic job inside with many nice pictures. a great choice for those who own or want to get a boxer. it will make both your lives easier and more fun.",1,58
"disappointing multi-player option: the game is interesting, but i was disappointed it didn't provide for a better multi-player experience. i thought it might provide a sweet 2 player mode similar to super mario wii. as a one player game, it's pretty good.",1,42
"dude...shintaro kago: the fact that it has the world's only english-language printing of a shintaro mother#*&%ing kago story makes this book an automatic must buy.oh, and don't buy it for the ridiculous used prices here. if you do a good amount of googling, you can still find it for sale at other places. i got my copy for around 20 bucks at some random uk book store. you can still find it for a good price, you just need to scour the internets.(i also thought the junko mizuno story was quite good and it made me buy more of her books. we need more weird, avant-gardeish manga like this in the us. as opposed to all the idiotic shounen draaaaagfests and mansexyaoifangirl stuff)",1,123
she likes glee i don't: she has seen season one only and was jonesing for season two. hubby to the rescue. i bought season two for her and she was eternaly greatful.,1,32
"a genuine funny but tender and romantic story: i generally don't like jim carrey's movies, but i have seen one or twofilms where he really gets to show his talent; and this is one of those films.although he plays a con man and gets to mug for the camera (many times); healso gets to play really sweet and touching love scenes with ewan mcgregor.everything about this film fits right. it's a little over 90 minutes, whichkeeps things moving swiftly.it's so terrific that these two male actors agreed to take on the challengeof playing gay lovers. everyone should see this film!",1,100
"a perfect workout for busy new moms.: yes, the outfits and the music are super cheesy. but for under $20 this is an awesome workout video for busy new moms. you can choose the length of your workout, and they are short and to the point, which is helpful for moms trying to squeeze in some exercise time while the baby is napping. the routines are very challenging and easy to follow. a great way to get back in shape after having a baby without ever having to leave the house.",1,91
"very easy to use: i purchased this item about a month ago to clean our 20 year old medium brown carpet. it really is very sturdy and easy to set up. just vacuum first, mix up the cleaner with water (i put in a small teapot full of boiling water along with the tap water), and clean away. water in the recovery tank is dark gray/black every time and easy to empty. wipe the bottom areas of the cleaner with paper towel when you're done (remove and rinse the brushes if you have time) and put away.i've done sections of the house little by little because it is so easy to get out and clean a section even if you only have an hour to work with. i'm only 5'1'' tall and find it easy enough to push around. it is noisy so i use earplugs to save my hearing.the best thing is that we're saving a ton of money over hiring a company to do it for you. buy the hoover detergent from amazon too! great price and it arrived in 1-2 days.",1,184
"love it, but...: great can, wonderful vibrant graphics, larger size than expected, high quality. lost a star because the bottom rusts! just like the shave cream cans in the shower used to. we have this in our ohio state bathroom that's just off the ohio state man cave. the moisture in the bathroom has caused a rust ring where the trash can sits. go bucks!",1,65
not for dummies: every thing works just fine except the program needs easier to follow instructions for someone that don't know there way with the computer.[like me!],1,27
"new ways to think about coincidences: after reading another book that was essentially a collection of coincidences and being inspired to start a coincidence journal of my own, i picked up bell's book to try to figure out what it all means.this is in many ways a scholarly book. bell defines different types of coincidences and weaves in elements of jung's theories, quantum mechanics and eastern religious thought to provide a framework for how to interpret these events. he gives interesting examples of coincidences and, unlike other books on coincidence i've read, ""translates"" them--looking beyond the ""oh, isn't that interesting"" to get to the possible message and meaning.his theory that coincidences are similar to dreams and can be interpreted as such changed my whole perception of coincidences. that alone was worth the price of the book.overall, a very interesting and illuminating book that may change the way you look at the world.",1,152
"excellant movie: anyone who enjoys an action type movie will enjoy it. it far exceeded what i was expecting from the normal ""invading alien"" sort of movie with a great story and surprise turn of events.",1,36
"crimson force: i bought this movie after having saw it years ago on the sci-fi channel. i liked how they worked in bits of the annunkai story into it. there's parts of it that are a bit ""cheesy"". it's a better movie to re-watch than some sci-fi movies. i'll watch it again.",1,52
"sturdy, compact but spacious: i bought this to keep just random personal papers and stuff in, nothing really ""valuable"" to outsiders. so i can't speak to the lock and safety, but the product is designed well. plenty of room for lots and lots of files inside every-day commercial file folders. i like it a lot, and it's pretty compact and inobtrusive",1,61
"come on rock , rockhead! go to it bad.: total incredible record from rocking men with guitars and mad drums! if you like rush you can't buy this album because it will kick you in the pucker. my father say, ""rock and roll is king."" you know he was right when i say it is---mad volume!! other ones say it is not the good album, that other fu manchu's are best. i cannot stand for this comment becausing this skateboard cover rock album kicks me to the shores of neptune!! when in rome, do as the japanese do and enjoy mary jane influence of 1970 pop culture hard metal. if it sounding like a band it was be sabbath or montrose but better than that. not as good as ventures, but you'll giddy as a cucumber over this sounds.",1,139
"very underrated debut by underrated band: i love this album. it's extremely solid. 'the world has turned and left me here', 'only in dreams', and 'undone - the sweater song' are the best tracks. people think of weezer of a novelty band and that couldn't be further from the truth.give it a chance and you will not be disappointed!",1,59
"this grinder handled the meat from 4 deer without problem..: until now, and because i was used to hand-grinding, i have preferred canning my venison; however, a friend loaned me her grinder attachment and, wow!- was i impressed! in a little over an hour i had made hamburger out of 4 deer, ready to package neatly in vacuum bags for the freezer. i was impressed that the unit could handle the semi-frozen meat fed continuously without hangup or overheating, and it only required one grinding to obtain terrific results. kudos, and many thanks to kitchenaid for a such a helpful product!",1,101
"yum: they really taste so good... i let my kids eat some, being organic makes me happier about them eating anything ""candy"" like, not like those junk filled ""fruit snacks"" from the store.",1,33
"oh my god: gotta b one of the best albums eva, im not usually into this sorta music, im more into, death metal nu metal n punk rock. but this stuff rocks. so buy the album, or ul b missing out!",1,41
helpful: this dvd was very helpful before i had my first baby. i wanted to be aware of the different things to do and what my husband should expect and it gave lots of information. loved it!,1,37
"real csi show!: it's just like the real program on tv! i felt like i'm part of the team! it's no graphic play, but definitely entertaining! i bought the 2nd edition, too!",1,32
"very accurate!: i can use this mouse on any surface what so ever! the mini receiver is so compact, without clutter.",1,21
fun french really was fun!: my almost four-year old twin grandchildren also love this cd. the boy especially likes goldilocks and the three bears; the girl likes the songs to make beginning french easily learned. the first copy i bought was defective but the replacement was very good. the voices are clear and easily understood. the vocabulary is quite age appropriate. excellent product!,1,63
vidal sassoon brush hair dryer: this is the second vidal sassoon hair dryer. the first one died after several years of use. i was happy to find one just like the previous one. quite happy with it. amazon order was easy and it came on time.,1,46
"another excellent book: love this series, every book keeps you glued to the pages with interest. im sad the series is almost over",1,23
"a little story of hope: well known author writing about a personal story, that of his widowed father finding a lost love.this is a book about hope. hope for something to live for. hope for things lost to be restored. hope for small odds. it is a gentle story of life's renewal, even for a couple who are great-grandparents. it is also about romance and the call of the heart.i am a family history buff and after reading the book the first time through, went back and pulled out the genealogy details, which amplified and enlarged the story itself.who cares? you say, well, if you are interested in the book's characters enough to go back through the book to better understand them then you know the book has been worth your time.a gentle read and heart warming, and good character studies. enjoy!",1,142
city of champions puzzle: this is a great puzzle for the boston sports fan. it's 550 pieces and works up pretty fast. i think we finished it in 3 days. a nice one to preserve and hang. : ),1,39
"some ars confusion: it is obvious some fans have completely mistaken this set for a budget cd released in the mid-90's, one which displayed re-makes in favor of the originals. that set was done to side-step contractual troubles regarding rights to material, as ars was trying to re-establish itself in the mid 90s. while the remakes are a curious listen, this 1991 polydor collection does tremendous justice to a wonderful group. i can't top kevin's great review seen in these pages, so this was mainly to clear up the misunderstanding about the bogus best-of. true, the new millenium set has superior sound, but a very short track list. i would still spring for the 91 edition, as it is solid top to bottom...artwork included. :)",1,125
"now this was a movie: if you are a super religious person the movie is not for you. open minded people would find this movie histerical. this movie from beginning to end made and think and laugh, all actors in the movie did a great job and keep your eye out on the cameos. if your looking for a keeper this one is for you.",1,65
"a fresh new approach to extremely difficult behavior: i just heard this gentleman speak about his ""plan b"" . he was easy to listen to. he makes sense. his book makes sense. ""clear the smoke"" first - we have to get past everything that we've placed around these children - our feelings, emotions, our ""bad"" behavior - before we can begin to assess what makes the child act the way s/he does. i love the basket idea - it's so simple, yet makes so much sense. it would work with any child, any issue. read the book - listen to him speak if you can.",1,105
"a good read: i have read a number of books on the pacific theater of the war and this was a good book. does not go into the details of the battles to much, but still gives you an idea how these great men of that generation live and died during those trying times.",1,54
pride and prejudice: the movie is the greatest for all the details- the remakes after this all vary on the theme and leave stuff out.this dvd is a 2 sider and i do not like that- i was not expecting that - seems cheaply done for such a nice classic,1,50
"10 years of data transferred seamlessly!: my first quicken product was quicken 94. then i upgraded to quicken 98 without any problems. in the last 10 years i've had all sorts of stock and price information stored in quicken, some of it entered daily. i got a little nervous when i read the bad reviews listed on this site. but you should not be nervous! all my data transferred instantly and quicken 2004 works beautifully without any glitches. in my years of owning quicken products i've never had to call customer support so it doesn't bother me that they charge by the minute. most of these other quicken users probably have problems with their operating systems and other glitches. the only time quicken didn't work right was when i had bugs in the system software. purchase a couple of good utility programs and everything in your computer will run fine! don't be afraid to buy this product.",1,157
"excellent toy!!!: at 4 months, my daughter would not bear much weight on her legs. after purchasing this product, that has all changed!!! she bounces in it all the time, plus has greater strength in her torso. she absolutely loves being in her exersaucer. it is amazing all that she has learned to do, from turning the pages of the electonic book to pulling on the toys from the bar. this is the best money i have spent on a toy for my daughter because not only has it helped her in reaching developmental milestones, but she smiles the entire time she is in it. i would highly recommend the smartsteps exersaucer to any parent.",1,115
"harry potter audio cd: very enjoyable audio book. however, one cd did have some skips in it,(book # 3). still listening to the cd's, but overall from what i have listened to, i would rate it 9 out 10 (because of the skips!).",1,43
"genius without question and totally unique: i'm not a big fan of artists that rely on sampling to create their music, but beck isn't relying on it for lack of creativity. he truly evolves the art of sampling and transforms it into something new. it is particularly impressive how he blends numerous styles that would at first seem conflicting, but he combines them in such a way as to be undeniably successful.",1,72
"a adorable doggie!: i got this a while ago. i love him.i named him doodles (cute, name, huh?) i got this got in the medium sized one and it is so soft and cuddly i take it everywhere and i am taking it on a camping trip for 3 nights 4 days (may 16-19) this is such a great stuffy.m~",1,60
"the absolute best cd that i own.: i was familiar with quite a number of his songs, but had no idea who it was. then after hearing 'we came to party', i had to have the cd. to my suprise, i knew the other songs on the album and after searching for 'all my love', i finally had it in my collection. after almost a year of owning this cd i still listen to it everyday. buy this cd, you will not be disappointed.",1,84

"great beginner's book (once you've learned a few basics): i love the progressive guitar books. they get you into music making right away. no wasted time. the examples and lessons are easy to grasp, and the cd's let you hear what you're tying to accomplish. academic music theory is taught secondarily. this book takes you right into that great blues sound. by the time i got 3/4 through the book, i couldn't believe what i could play. i love to listen to the cd just for musical enjoyment.",1,88
"the best sales book in the world: i got into the sales line recently. badly needing advice on how to succeed in it, i have read a couple of sales books. but i don't seem to learn much and was not at all inspired by them. until, i discovered this book by frank bettger. reading this book, i found frank a very sincere person, one happy to pass on all the successful sales experiences he had garnered to readers.no doubt about is. this is the best sales book in the world. any reader will benefit tremendously from it.",1,98
"andy williams at his best: these two albums are a collection of lesser known andy williams songs that are masterfully mixed and interwoven. the entire series of songs related to if wishes were horses and the sense of living in the moment, using a new christy minstrals hit song, brings back wonderful memories and provides a provocative listening experience, as well as being a window into the personal challenges and emotions of the artist at that time.",1,77
"i loved this book.: this book was so much fun to read. it is definitely my favorite, next to the dark elf trilogy. no, drizzt is not in it. when i first realized that, i was afraid that i would be disappointed. that was not the case at all. i was never a fan of the ""bad guys"", but jarlaxle and artemis are so expertly written about in this book, that you can't help but enjoy their partnership.the dialogue between the characters is very witty. there are numerous times i go back to the book to re-read certain scenes. the surface is only scratched at letting you get to know what drives these characters and this book will only leave you wanting to know more. at the end of the book, there is also a very big bombshell dropped regarding jarlaxle, that will leave you wondering even more about his character.this book is a must read in this series. do yourself a favor and check it out.",1,167
"great disc: this band seems to be unknown to most people. i believe they officially changed thier name to magnolia electric co. after this disc. this was the first disc i heard from this group. i instantly liked the disc. i sought out older discs by songs:ohia and found more great music, but they seemed to be paving the way for this record. the music has sort of a country/alt rock type sound that is hard to classify. jason molina lead vocals have a unique sound with great lyrics. there is a sense of sadness to most of the tracks, but the album is not a downer as most songs also seem to have a few lines expressing some type of hope or longing.simply put, i really like this disc and i always will wonder why a group with such a great sound goes somewhat unknown",1,146
"helen reddy: contains two top 40 songs from the seventies that is not on her greatest hits album, bluebird and music is my life.",1,24
"percussion as it should be: this is a truly inspired album. leon parker, unlike many of his contemporaries, does not buy into the dennis chambers school of drumming (aka showing off). parker, on the set, is a minimalist in that he has stripped his set to the bare essentials. on top of that, his actual playing on the set is drumming as it should be - he lays down a funky riff to support some fantastic side musicians. on top of this, parker explores different modes of expression through percussion, such as his body and voice. the cd contains inspired playing by parker and all musicians, but also contains amazing ensemble work. i highly reccommend this.",1,116
"the best one!!!: this is the best mp3 player that you can get. the only negative thing, is the short battery life. this is an excelente device to take with you when you wanna take a walk.",1,37
"unbelievable film.: some others have described the plot to you so i won't belabor the details. suffice it to say that this is a disturbingly creepy film. you have 10 times the terror, suspence, and tension that you' d get from the run of the mill slasher film, without the gore. i'm not much into blood for the sake of it in films.there are some very disturbing scenes but the film's tension is based in the brilliance of the screenplay, cinematography, and the fabulous performance of the actors. i'd recommend frailty to anyone.",1,93
"deep blue is deep adventure: a fast-paced plot, well-drawn characters and lots of twists and turns embraces and draws in the reader. if this is a taste if what the series offers, i can't wait for mystery #2.to read the rest of the review go to author's choice reviewshttp://come.to/bookreviews",1,49
"difficult to put on my french bulldog puppy: this harness fits my 7-lb french bulldog puppy. however, it is challenging to put on her because of her large ears. i imagine it is easier for other dogs with smaller ears. other than that, it's super-cute, lots of compliments and its much more comfortable for her than a collar.",1,58
"fantastic!: recently received my copy of ""windows on the past..."" and just loved it! sue gutierrez has truly captured carlsbad's history, from its early beginnings to the present day. i was very impressed by how she managed to make her historical facts come to life, as well as her careful use of photographs, maps, and first-hand accounts...a great read! i highly recommend this book, and am looking forward to other works by this author!",1,74

"the most accurate translation available today!: as a bible college graduate, i have had the privilege of reviewing more than 50 different bible translations as well as studying the hebrew and greek texts. when i study the bible, i want to make sure that what i am reading is accurate. mr rotherham was a good hebrew and greek scholar who was very careful in how he interpreted the sacred scriptures. although there are other good bible translations, there are also several poor translations. from personal experience, i believe that the emphasized bible is the most accurate translation that we have available in english today.",1,104
great cans: this will be a short review in that i'm not an audiophile. these are some great headphones. sound is crisp and clear. on my big head they are quite comfy. for 90 bucks i doubt that you'll find better.,1,41
one of the greatest!: joanie madden is the best selling whistle player of all time.... her albums song of the irish whistle 1 and song of the irish whistle 2 are beautiful heart wrenching and soul moving masterpieces. whistle on the wind is joanie's first solo album and delves into the more fast virtuoso playing. no wonder she won two world champion titles on whistle! it's fantastic!,1,67
recieved: i received the movie in a timely manner. there were no scratches or damage of any kind to the disc or the case considering i bought it used.,1,29

"how sweet the sound is!: if this box set only had the song ""midnight sun"", that in itself would be worth the price. this song is so beautifully done. however, there are other great songs as well like ""laura"", ""that's all"", ""ruby"", ""if he walked into my life"". all done in the beautiful relaxing serene style that the jackie gleason orchestra is known for.",1,64
"well worth the money but it could'vw been better.: after waiting ages since 'razorblade suitcase' i rushed out to buy this. its definately more polished than the others but lacks the power of razorblade, it also lacks a song of the calibre of 'swallowed' but there is enough variety here to keep me listenening, but although its a good album i keep heading back to the last one.",1,68

"kick ass cool: this ring speaks for itself...it's kick ass cool! great weight, quality & detail. it's not a huge ring but the image speaks volumes. strangers & co-workers always do a double-take when they spot it on my hand. i'm a petite, asian, girl working at a design company so you can imagine the kinds of responses i get!",1,60
"fascinating esoterica- merlin the magician: this book covers the mysterious legend of merlin the magician in interesting detail. his welsh heritage, his connections with taliesin, the arthurian legends. if you're a fan of fantasy fiction such as tolkien or cs lewis, or even lloyd alexander, you owe it to yourself to read this book!apparently, merlin was not only a magician, but a musician. he played a banjo-like instrument, an interesting setup. and the kind of magic he did was not cups and balls, but the alchemical variety.",1,87
scary ending but a boring first half hour: the first thing about the film i heard was from a friend who said that it is supposed to be one of the scariest movies ever. about a month later everyone was saying how good it should be. it came out at the cinema in england on friday the 29th of october and so i went to a local cinema to try to watch it but it was sold out this made my expectations even higher .i eventually got to watch it the next day with a couple of friends .i found the first half an hour boring but the ending was superb. when i went back to school on monday many people had seen it and they all said the same the ending is brilliant. a must see film for horror and scary movie lovers,1,144

"omg!! hilarious isnt the word!!!!!: if you want to have a fun night of laughing til it hurts, then you need to get this jeff dunham dvd!! i never heard of him, but a friend recommended the dvd, and oh my gosh, it was soooo hilarious. he is not a 'raunchy' comedian/vantriliquist. he doesnt have to use profanity like others do to get the crowd going. jeff dunham rocks!!!!! both of his dvd's are awesome. get them both!!!jeff dunham - arguing with myselfjeff dunham: spark of insanity",1,87
"good book !!!: this book was good, i must say it does start off really slow but by the time this book introduced jay's character ( who i must say im in love with ) it was super charged with passion !! this book oozed an urgent passion between the two main characters that one would only be so lucky to have experienced. i could have done without all the fashion crap that part was losing me !! but overall it was a good read and im demanding a sequel !!",1,91

"going on almost 3 years ....: come this christmas (2002) it will be 3 years since my sister bought this for my nephew. at three he still plays with it, trying to get us adults to walk around with it between our legs as if we're riding it. however his will soon have to make it's way to the garbage as it doesn't hold the air anymore.",1,67
"greatest manson album so far!!!!!!!: this by far is the best manson album yet! i own all his stuff, and this has to be the greatest mix of heavy guitar, mixed with wonderful and poetic lyrics. the lyrics are a combination of wonderfully thought of words and also meaningfull boasts towards those who apose. if you are a manson fan, or just looking for a kick[in] heavy metal cd to buy, i'd get this. i don't know if the dvd makes a difference, but if you can get it cheaper without the dvd, i'd do it. cause, the dvd is just a movie that manson made, and it's artistic, but not worth extra dollars. just my opinion though.",1,118
"cliff bars: the cliff bar tastes good and uses organic ingredients, which i appreciate. it's not too sweet and is very filling. on busy days when i do not get a lunch break at work i can nibble on the bar and not feel hungry until dinner time. my teenager puts one is his sports bag for ""away"" games.",1,59
"loved it, but...: this game is awesome! for the tykes and adult ppg fans as well. exellent graphics, and very fast gameplay. unfortunately, on my system, the direct x movies tend to ""chug"" a bit.other than that, i highly recomend it! a 5 plus!!!",1,44
"riveting story line !: as the 2nd book of a series it is as good a read as the first. it continues where the first book ends and takes you on a wild ride that will have you staying up late to find out what happens next. i read the entire book in 2 days. i was captivated and totally enjoyed the story line and plot. you don't have to read the book series in order, but it sure helps. this book stands on it's own merits as quite a good read. i recommend this book to anyone interested in the subject of the nephilim. if you have never heard of the nephilim, then you need to read this book !",1,121
"outstanding: probably the finest expose written detailing the forgotten history and law behind the way our country used to view military operations and service. much of today's understanding, regarding the military establishment and our government's use of it, is a recent development. up until the korean war, the military was under the exclusive direction of the congress; but this book shows how the executive branch has usurped congress's authority with the public's knowledge and acquiescence.",1,75
"moved me to tears.: i read this book a while back and loved it. i know it is fiction but it left me in tears. the loss of amir's innocence, hassan's friendship, the family livelihood and human life in general was too much. the author's writing is so captivating that it made me feel as if i was there. it was also good to learn how afghanistan used to be before the taliban. i had to rush and read his next book.",1,82

"just what i was looking for.: well as a newbie to horse racing, all the data at hand was quite overwhelming. i mean where does one start? while perusing the web i came across this book. i'm so glad that i did! this book has everything you need to get down to some intelligent betting. my first application of the knowledge i got from this book was quite successful (got the trifecta on my very fist try, and these weren't favorites! also was in the money for all the other races i bet that day (4)... beginners luck?). now i have a good basic understanding and a bit of confidence when betting.the only reason this book got 4 stars is that it lacks a glossary.",1,125

"hate to do it...but it's a 3 1/2 really...: can't say that i totally hated insomnia, but also can't say that i recommend it to other people. it was very interesting with lots of likable characters and such...but it just wouldn't get to it! sure the ending is crazy like all stephen king endings, but it took forever to get there. the storyline is a good, well-thought out one with interesting turns to it. king creates a wonderful cast of real and likable characters caught in a mess of insomnia, violence, and abortion. this is a good book, it just took me a long time to read. sometimes you have to patient with it, in the end something does happen. what i liked best about the ending was that it did not just end abruptly. there was an ending, and then the epilouge was a whole other ending altogether and it really made the book worth it. very nice.",1,159
"the airplane at their peak: one of the most anthemic of rock and roll bands, this album features two of the airplane's best anthems ('we should be together' and 'volunteers of america') as well as several cuts of unmatched musical beauty and spiritual harmony. and a russian army song. still has a place of honor on my turntable, after all these years.",1,62

"a novel for casual cooks: i've owned this book for about a year now, and today when i realized how often i consult it for cooking and baking, i had to write a review. this cookbook offers far more than recipes! it offers basics of food preparation, suggestions and ideas for alternatives to standard recipes, some background information on where particular dishes originated, and just general helpful hints. i use this book whether i'm creating something on my own in the kitchen, trying a recipe from a friend or another cookbook, or preparing one of mark bittman's dishes. today i was looking for a recipe for pizza dough, and found myself caught up in reading an entire section! the instructions are clear and concise, and the language draws in even cooks with the most casual interest. i would recommend this for anyone who enjoys food preparation - regardless of their skill level. this is a fantastic reference and cookbook, and would make a great gift!",1,165

"great guitar if you're willing to pay the $: there's always a lot of sour grapes when something is somewhat overpriced. i couldn't afford an original '57 since they go for about $100,000 (even though they cost about $125 in 1957). i have tryed several and even comapred the re-issue with an original. i could not tell the differnce between the original and the reissue. so i setlled for a reissue and it plays and sounds fantastic. i have tried many different gibsons and most are hit and miss but a good re-issue is worth the price.",1,97

"man used by god: todd is an example who is obedient enough to go through things that brought about purification. as you can see god uses him in miraculous ways. a false prophet is one who directs people to worship other gods or themself, todd does not do that. he exalts the king of kings and lord of lords and is evident in his walk and fruits of the holy spirit.his book is an autobiography of his life and what god is doing. beyond fascinating people get healed in his meetings and revivals. its all about god and we too should be obedient and hungry to do john 14:12.this book documents what god has done and his staff was there to back him up. he is the real deal and so different that he does not fit the mold of the usual christianity that we like to box ourselves in. if we grow up and get beyond the tattoos we can see that god uses anyone and can use us.",1,170

"great introduction to how web teams work: i give a copy of this book to new hires at my company (a small nyc web marketing and development firm) who are entry level or do not have past experience working as part of a diversified web development team.this book is probably not totally ""eye-opening"" to those who have worked at any of the well established web agencies/development companies (like me), but it's still useful to compare notes on your own production process and best practices versus that described in burdman's book (basically red sky interactive's process). and the cd with sample forms is interesting and may inspire some processes you might want to try.the only way this book could be a bit better is if it had more ""what to do when x happens"". there are standard process errors and client demands/misunderstandings that result in various process issues that could be addressed in this book more thoroughly.",1,156
"new insights into the nazi hierarchy: in his biography of joseph goebbels david irving has provided some masterful and provocative insights into the inner workings of the nazi hierarchy. however, the book is sometimes confusingly organized and irving's use of the present tense when describing past events can be irritating and seem a bit amaturish in so seasoned a writer.with these caveats in mind, this is still an important book and necessary reading for any student of world war ii. mr. irving is neither a holocaust denier nor a proponent of the nazis or their ideology; he simply has a different point of view. it's amazing how vociferous and censorious the academic history establishment can become when their 'established' truths are challenged; and in this book, mr. irving has done just that.",1,132
"just what my husband needed!...awesome book!: this book was so wonderful in preparing my husband to be an awesome coach! we had our baby three months early and not started our birthing classes yet, but he had already read this book. when i was in labor he used the ideas shared in this book and he was such a great help to me!i would highly recommend this book for couples to read together in preparation for childbirth. i also think that this would make a great shower gift!",1,88
"novels as good as this one are scarce as ...................: ""hen's teeth"" is a darned good novel. scott is a fine craftsman of the written language: her evocative descriptions of animal life, of nature, of the world of science, and of human relationships is fresh and intriguing. the plot is complex and intellectual and involves the reader up and through the surprising ending. and the heroine, kellen stewart, is a delight. after i post this review, i'm going to order manda scott's next book!",1,84

"excellent alternative to the original develop 10 program: i used the original develop 10 program and it's fantastic for turning short, weak nails into long, strong nails... but the formaldehyde in the original formula began to irritate my finger tips so i switched to the calcium gel. it's just as good as the original but with no irritation. this is a great product and i'm glad to see that it's becoming less difficult to find.",1,75

""this is the heartache"" is a wonderful song! also, ""places in the heart"" is great along with ""ready to fall"".

"it's ok, does the job: the panavise junior is a funny blend of heavy metal base with a plastic vise. the vise jaws are not very rigid, though for holding circuit boards and wires for soldering they do the job ok. the ball joint is a bit annoying as it's hard to lock it down tight enought, and i would prefer a real ball joint that is not restricted to a single axis. i'm leery of reefing down on plastic parts because they like to break. i've had mine a few months and it's holding up all right, and it appears to be metal-reinforced where it counts.",1,107

funny but serious too: i enjoyed the various characters who took the bus ride to the afterlife. some carried their sinful ways with them and didn't make it to the mountain (heaven). the observer who told the story seemed very humble to me and i liked him right away. it was interesting to read the descriptions of the afterlife from c.s. lewis' perspective.,1,63

"babies and bachelors: nick novak was the talk of the town and the most eligible bachelor around. he was so popular that newcomer martha rose, a creature of impulse, had to ask him out on a date. she was a great catch-spontaneous, resourceful and had started her own business. to her shock, nick promptly turned her down.what martha soon discovered was that nick was the darling of the rumor mill. the man had a little secret and approached life with caution. but it also became clear that nick was the kind of man who couldn't help being fascinated by a creature of impulse...",1,103
"great invention: ""i received the oralflo pill cup 2 days after ordering it and it is amazing!!! even as a child i had problems swallowing large pills and tried everything including buttering the pills to cutting them into smaller pieces. with this cup i had no problem swallowing even the largest of my vitamin pills without them hanging up in the back of my throat and causing me to gag. the flow of water along with the pill eliminated the problem. i highly recommend it especially for older adults and children. a great invention and well worth the money!!!!!""",1,99

"for the right audience, a good book: there are many good things about this book - the theorems are beuatiful and they are part of 'real' mathematics. the writing is reasonably good. the only qualm i have is that the audience is quite specialized, more so than for most 'popular math' books. i think that anyone who has not had at least 3 semesters of calculus will find this mostly meaningless. however, for those who are familiar with calculus, this is an excellent book.",1,84
"nice suit!: shipping was extra fast. the quality of it is really nice as well. only thing about it is that the front pockets aren't usuable. the inside pockets work fine though :-) it's worth the money. so if you're in need of a quality suit fast, then i highly recommend getting this one. can't go wrong with this one at all!",1,62
this is my number favorite rap cd. buy it!: this isn't one of the newest spice 1 cuts out there but it is the best by far. take it from someone who has about every spice 1 cd. every cut on the disc is hotter than fish greese!,1,48

bunn nhbx-b contemporary 10 cup home coffee brewer: this is my fourth bunn coffee maker. i have always liked how fast coffee making was with a bunn.the last two i have had have been a real disappointment. the coffee pot has permanent water marks etched into the coffee pot.it also has brown stains on the sides - can't get off. on the outside of the coffee maker itself there are corroded water marks thatdo not wipe off - you have to scrape the build-up off. when you slide the top to pour in the water - there gets to be a build-upof water that gets just crusty. when this is scraped off it just comes right back. i have to ream the coffee maker out monthly ormore since it slows down so much and takes 20 min. to brew a pot. i do the vinegar treatment and then have to brew about 10 potsto get rid of the vinegar smell/taste! so totally unhappy with this coffee pot - i will not buy a bunn again. the qualityis just poor. they used to have such a reliable coffee maker. not anymore!,1,190

"i only wish: i only wish that i could have taken a class from richard feynman. this is not a book about physics. it is a book about of the most brilliant physics minds of the last century and a good guy to boot. it is a book that i have read to my kids (the chapters are each an episode or incident in feynman's life and are hilarious, touching, and insightful). i can not recommend this book too highly.",1,80

"eldoncard great product: i bought the eldoncard blood typing kit because i was not able to get in touch with my children's pediatrician, being that he retired and is no longer practicing. i could not find any blood type in my childrens medical records. therefore i bought the eldoncard blood typing kit. the product was everything it said it would be. i was able to tell the blood types of my children in a matter of minutes, plus i was able to laminate the cards and keep them in a file. great product.",1,93

"a 40 watt light bulb works: i don't own a zeno, but i read about the idea of heat treating cystic acne thanks to zeno. it does work, but there's no need to spend $185. a 40 or 60 watt light bulb in a lamp does the trick. turn the lamp on, take the lampshade off, and hold the bulb against the zit for a couple minutes. briefly switch the lamp off if it gets too hot.",1,77
"excellent information & advice!: this book was suggested to our sewing guild during a recent class on fitting. many of us struggle with finding our own style based on the shape of our bodies. this book gives excellent advice on clothing styles, accessories, shoes, and even makeup suggestions - ""don't overdo it""! classic white shirts, great-fitting jeans, and coats. and, it provides you with brand suggestions as well as where you can get them. ready-to-wear doesn't fit most of us so they suggest finding a great tailor to help with the fit. thank goodness we can do that now! i purchased 6 copies of the book for some of our guild members and i have someone else requesting 2 more copies. i highly recommend this book as an excellent guide to finding and creating your own style.",1,137

"excellent strummer solo effort: i've loved this disc ever since i found it in a bargain bin in the early 1990s. don't know why it was so maligned on its initial release. it contains some of strummer's best stuff. i'm glad to see it's getting some love from reviewers. sucks this release is cd-r, though i see it also includes an mp3 version free. i'm glad i've got the actual cd with the lyric insert, but take what you can get folks. after reading about this release in a bio of strummer, i'm surprised it's available at all.",1,98
"just some food for thought: i recently saw this movie over the christmas holiday with my wife and mother-inlaw. we all thought that the movie was excellent. it was very thought provocking. i know that the one thing that occured to me was that the rapture could happen at any time!, and the time is of the essence to share the truth of god's word with as many people as possible. we thought the cast did a great job, especially nickolea. we will spread the word of this movie and of it's feb. 2nd release date. we will be there!",1,100

"amazing music!!: well the movie was quite complicated so its understandable to see very different opinions about it. to me it was a nice film,a little too long though,with good killings,nice weird characters,nice costumes and anyway something different for a european who is used to european and american film-making. worth to see it once.but...tha extraordinary,fantastic and brilliant part of the movie was the weirdo-bard that was singing every once in a while with his guitar...his songs were great!!! the movie worth buying or hiring just to listen to those songs! please does anybody knows how can i find those tunes???? please help!!!send me an e-mail or something.. :)",1,108
"great early graphics: this is such an awesome game, and is so much better than the first one, i really enjoy the ablility to play two totally diffrent characters in the same action game. if you like kids games like spyro, and gex you'll love this one!",1,47

"omg what a lifesaver!!!!!!!: this is the best teether ever!!! my 5 month old is soo picky when it comes to teethers. i tried everything from teething beads, frozen pacifier, washclothes and oragel. nothing helped for more then 2 minutes. once i gave this to him he immediately put it in his mouth and started chewing on it. it looks like a pacifier so he knows already to put it in his mouth. i got the all blue one because i heard the multicolor one would comes apart. i love this teether soo much i am going to buy more. i just wish it came with more solid colors. besides that i love it, my son loves it. its amazing!",1,120
"puppy can't get enough of this: our puppy loves this toy. there are other toys that get tossed by the wayside after a few rounds of playtime, but this is one of his favorites. the different textures- rope and fabric- are endlessly entertaining for him to chew on and chase and it is great quality!

"campy but fun: wasn't around when this came out but glad i am here to see the new release. this was honestly a horrible film but being that most of the scenes were ad-libbed was honestly funny. verry funny indeed. it just works. the 3-d in anagliph doesn't work very well but for depth-of-field works. out of screen effects don't really work but are noticed. still, for a bad movie, this one is just a ride at the funpark you have to take. bad but good in every sense.",1,89
huge hit!: i bought this for my 15 month old son and he loved it!! he pushes is around every where and it actually sucks some! i had to empty it after days of work :).amber,1,36
"chilling, striking, amazing....: all i can say is, wow! i know most everybody has read, or at least heard about anne frank's life story, diary, or perhaps just the name. either way, if you haven't read frank's diary, i highly recommend reading it asap! if you have, i highly recommend reading it again as soon as you can! anne frank is so strong, brave, and far beyond her years. in the worst of times, she shows the curiousity, and hope of a young child. she remains so positive throughout. there is definitely a reason why her diary is so widely recognized, and taught throughout schools. everyone can learn a little something, or be more appreciative, thankful, for the life they do have, and freedoms we often take for granted, after reading it. good for teenages, young adults, and adults of all ages!!",1,142
"a stunning book: it's rare for me or anyone to find a book that is completely engrossing. this one is. few writers can make you feel what the character feels. jane smiley does. amazing writing and a story that tugs at your heart and your sense of right and wrong. at times the actions of the characters do not make sense, and that makes the story more real. scenes and actions are glued together with the inertia of life. and, no doubt, these are real people living simple, complex, happy and deeply dark and disturbed lives. great book and i am glad i read it. this one is going on my keeper shelf.",1,113
"prompt delivery: wonderful seller! very quick delivery and the product was in gret shape, just as described.",1,17
"beautiful movie but quality controlstinks: this is one awesome movie. i was moved to tears more than once. jamie bell is pure talent. hope to see more of him in the future. i am on my third disk and quality control (...). i am going to have to return this one. at several points on the dvd it simply stops, pauses for a few seconds, starts again. sometimes it reverts to an earlier scene. i have yet to watch the entire movie from start to finish.",1,86
"simply functional.: i bought two of these at the same time as the hks plain double speedloader case, could not be happier with the setup. i just keep this in my bag loaded up and know i have some quickly accessible spare ammo with my gun at all times. the loader itself hold rounds securely and drops them into the cylinder easily.",1,62
"african lions with english accents : d: pride is a wonderful bbc film about lions that live on the pride. they have english accents which makes it a little silly, and it's live action. they animate the mouths as people have done in the past in many other films. it's about family, finding ones self, and survival.",1,57
"sound so good i never imagine: i bought this bose 3-2-1 gsx dvd home entertainment system - dvd surround system - radio / dvd - silver a couple mothns ago and satisfied to the sound and portability i set up good because you did not set up good the sound is awful you cannot hear the bass and sound so weird when you not set up good , you must read the manual first, so i read the manual and i set up in my own now it soud great in my dvd and the in my compilation of my cds in the hardrive feels so great because all my cd collection board in my compilation and the ii put the hdmi in my tv wow its so nice to hear the sound quality of the bose 3-2-1 gsx you will apprreciate it , i know thi is a small room only not for the bigger room in my living , not like my own component in my living room with the big speakers and pioneer receiver yeah it is better sound because it design to the bigger space but this bose is only for the small space room that is great for.. ii recommended this product",1,207
"something more: i'm not sure what i was expecting from this book, but i didn't quite find it: i found something more. i was impressed with the way moriarty was able to capture the reality of her protagonist's perspective as she move through childhood and adolescence. a coming of age story for the nerdy girl who wants to be loved, the good girl who isn't sure she wants to be good, the gifted girl who must make something out of nothing and figure out what's really important along the way.",1,90
"the great great book of amber: for those of us who have been through these book a lot, it was nice to get them all together in one volume. i bought this to replace the missing holes in my collection, after having lost them to various friends over the years (what is it that zelazny says about friends and books?)i wish this volume contained the amber short stories that zelazny published after the 2nd series, just to ensure that it was complete.",1,82
"garmin gps portable dash mount: mount is just what i was looking for and works as i hoped it would. very solid and stable, stayed exactly where i placed it. i've just returned from a 4600 mile trip using it all the way. the gps was solid - no vibration, no movement and i could adjust the gps if i got any glare. i could put it under the seat when stopped so i wasn't worried about theft. i was pleased with the price and performance. good buy.",1,88
"stand jacks: have pop up camper with stabilizing jacks attached to it. they are difficult to access to with bad shoulders, so jacks are very handy and adjust to any height i need, whereas the original jacks on camper, shimming is required.",1,42
works great: this is a much better alternative to the suction cup mount that came with my gps. just place it on your dash and it stays in place perfectly.,1,30
"not for everyone but very true for many: o.k. love is not the same for all, however, this movie did demonstrate how love is shared for some couples. this film comes off so true for some of my experiences with love. is this healthy love??? maybe or maybe not the point is that loved ones that share so many years together is not always the smoothest road. for many it takes strugle and even a little tourment but the point of the movie is to show that even love that does not come easily is still wirth it.. i loved the movie because of how real it was for me. i know it was not that way for all that is just how i felt about it",1,127
"good story, poor proofreading: the story is biblically based and very scary. i really enjoyed it, but there seemed to be at least one typographical or grammatical error on each page. then i purchased the second book and found it to be worse in the proofreading department. i'm not sure if this is because of its conversion to kindle or if those errors were in the original text. these are the kinds of errors that really detract from the reading experience and take one out of the story. makes me wonder if these books were rushed to publication without a qualified editor. i probably will not purchase the third one for that reason.",1,113
"timeless classic: i remember hearing ""the devil went down to georgia"" in my teens and vowed to buy this cd as part of my collection of classics from years gone by. i wasn't disappointed when my cd arrived either. i put it on straight away and much to my surprise (and happiness) my kids love it too and they're aged 22,20 and 15! this truly is a great collection of some of the best hits the charlie daniels band released over the years. a must-have for any serious music collector",1,90
"enjoyable read despite quirks: as much as i love nora roberts, i can't give this re-release of playing the odds and tempting fate five stars. why? for starters, as much as i wanted to i just couldn't get past the ""time warp"" problem. there is no way that couples who met, fell in love, and married during the 80s can have adult children in the 90s. i haven't read daniel's story yet, but i'm sure i'll find it even weirder that by the time of the macgregor brides, he's 91! secondly, caine's constant lighting up of cigarettes drove me crazy. i'm sorry, but i wouldn't french kiss anyone who smokes as much as he did in his story. yuck! and lastly, if an author is going to write a family saga, she should remember what she's written in previous books. in laura's story in brides, roberts alludes to caine finally convincing diana to take that walk down the aisle. wrong! in caine's story, diana proposes marriage to caine. despite all that, the romances are wonderful. roberts is one of the best.",1,181
a woman's charm is an inborn gift...: even as a baby !but it can become an art if you polish it carefully with the tips of this book..and it's a very satisfactory art ! try it! it's worth it!,1,39
"what a great collection!: i must confess that i'm a very big fan of cat stevens. this collection satisfied me completely. the only thing i miss about this collection is one or two of my favorite songs (rubylove, two fine people) but all in all, i'm extremely happy i got hold of this collection.",1,54
great for infants and toddlers: great little book for infants' tiny hands. my 6 month old loves to hold this book and gets even more excited when i read and sing the wheels on the bus song to him. even his 3 year old sis loves the book too. highly recommended!,1,51
"good information and meditations: this is good stuff. john talks fast but clear and crams aa lot of information into these two discs. but, these twodiscs are also included in the developing your own psychicpowers 6 disc set. no need to buy both.",1,43
pleased with performance: we purchased this gate to put around our christmas tree so that our 3 year old and 10 month old wouldn't hurt themselves on the glass ornaments. the gate was easy to set-up and has proven to be a sturdy solution for keeping the children away from potential danger(s) during the holiday season. we already have plans to use the gate in other areas of our home after the holidays.,1,73
"a look into the amana colonies: this is the only book of its kind written by an observer of the amana colonies during the era when the people lived under religious communism.mrs. shambaugh made repeated trips to the amanas and became a lifelong friend of the amana people. this rare book tells of life in the amana colonies at the turn of the century.the amana people voted in 1932 to live under free enterprise, incorporating their land and businesses as the amana society and establishing a separate amana church society. the people brought their own homes and many opened small businesses. with their traditional german family style restaurants, the amanas today are iowa's premier tourist attraction.",1,116
"can't go wrong: this really is yoga for everyone. i would suggest it for those who want to really get into yoga. it's got a wealth of information, lots of detail in the yoga practices, and lots of different routines. it is great how much is on this one video.",1,50
"a book for all levels: i have been in the food service industry for 18 years, and am always looking for new ideas. a friend told me about this book a month ago and i've been having fun with it ever since. there are so many original designs and instructions on how to create them. and many are easy enough for my kids to do.",1,65
"found it outside mx!: for some reason i couldn't find this cd anymore on any music store in mx, found it here with the plus that it includes the movie... this is great!",1,33
"works great!: i think the new kensington 62348 contour roller carrying case is great! it holds my 17 inch laptop with ease and has several individual compartments for the charger, cables, mouse, etc.the longer handle really is nice too. i can actually pull it 'behind' me without bending over like i've had to do with several other roll-a-board cases i've had or tried.the wheels located on the extreme corners certainly help keep it more stable while rolling than others that have the wheels closer together.",1,85
"good, but not great: it was an okay movie, but i don't think i would want to watch it over and over again. obsessed with writing a report on sexual fantasies, decent and charming writer, mark demetrius, (played beautifully by vincent spano) goes about it the sexy way--by doing phone interviews with ladies with erotic stories to tell. his obsession goes from the office to real life and before he knows it, he is entangled in a web of lies, sex, and murder! the plot is fast-paced with one enchanted bad event leading on to a sizzling worse event. and when you think things couldn't get any more twisted, the conclusion blows up in your face.",1,116
"getting better all the time: with each new release, steven curtis chapman expands his ability to express passion through his music. more and more he moves beyond the soft, contemplative, predictable songs of his early career and ventures into stronger lyrics and more soulful music. he hasn't quite hit his peak yet, but the growth is really starting to show.edgier songs include lord of the dance, the walk and rubber meets the road, songs that challenge with their lyrics and motivate with their music. some softer but equally good tunes include the moving free and inspiring let us pray. most of the rest seem to hover in the vanilla zone, not bad but not outstanding either.again, if i had rated this back in 1996, i probably would have given it 5 stars. knowing how far along chapman has progressed, and the level of his ability that this album represents, i give it a strong four.larry hehn, author of get the prize: nine keys for a life of victory",1,168
a great movie which captures the feel of the early 80s.: alan alda did a splendid job in capturing the feel of the lives of these persons as they dealt with the ups and downs of life in the early 80s. it will touch every emotion in you in a way that you can really relate to the story.,1,59

"his best: oakenfold may be a little overrated, but this along with another world, travelling, and his remix of when the world ends from dave matthews band on the matrix 2 soundtrack are amazing stuff. that's the only oakenfold to really get. everything else he just let his ego carry. which i don't blame the guy. if i was called the best dj in the world, i would want to take it easy sometimes too. this album is evidence of why he's the best. most of his albums don't give him justice.",1,92
"super light and high: these boot-less waders are so much lighter than my old 'clunkers' with the rubber boots attached. camo pattern is great, the waders really go up to my armpits. high surface area velcro shoulder straps are secure but if you have to take them off to piss, the critters will hear that velcro. double knees and big pocket.",1,61
"whelping and rearing of puppies: this book is wonderful. i am a first time breeder and this book provided so much information in just the first few pages, it was amazing. the author muriel lee is great and gives direct and concise directions on the birthing process and the raising and close watching of the pups. my 10 standand poodle pups are 2 weeks old now and are large and thriving - we almost lost 2 of them, but with our knowledge from this book we were able to revive them. they are all now happy, fat and very healthy. thanks to the wonderful insite of muriel lee, photos and the wonderfully informative book.",1,114
"pretty good: this is a pretty good trimmer. the vacuum is not 100% effective, but it does a pretty good job. the battery is also pretty reliable. cleaning is very easy, and i don't believe it ever has to be oiled, which is quite a convenience.",1,46
"easy to use: the home screen is divided into three sections with icons representing income, accounts and payees. all transactions are recorded using a combination of these icons which are easy to set up. record keeping requires little effort and the system allows construction of budgets; reports of expeditures against budgets, itemized expenditures by category and dozens of others. i have tried money and quicken and think this by far the easiest to use. it was originally developed by computer associates for kiplinger personal finance.",1,85
"better battery life: i guess kodak must have upgraded their line-up, 'cause my k1000 charger came with 1600 mah rated aas. if i knew they were doing this, i woudn't have to buy an additional 1600 mah aas from ebay. but hey, i now have 3 sets of aas... bring on the digicam!",1,53
"very real!: the sight and sound is extremely real and i actually feel warmer when the dvd is playing. i do believe the description said 90 minutes long, but it really is only 45 minutes and then repeats. i was a little disappointed in that. but i gave it five stars anyway because the quality of the sight and sound are so awesome, it greatly overshadowed that little disappointment.",1,69
"excellent.: i am loved this top notch movie, soundtrack, and cast. it is good to have it remastered as well. thanks.",1,21
"great fan!: we bought 2 of these fans for our patio. they are beautiful and work great. the only disappointment, the sail cloth appeared white in the pictures but is really more of a cream and it's a silky material, not canvas. neither issue was cause to send them back, they look great up and really move the air!",1,59
"loved it: this is a must read for the confused college grad, floundering young single or even twentysomthing working man or woman. this book radically changed my outlook in this awkward life stage known as the ""twentys,"" and it will do the same for you.",1,45
senior exercise dvd: came timely and in expected condition. (can't review product itself; haven't been able to try it outyet.),1,20
"not bad for a cheapo: it doesn't come with three ratchets like it states, but it does have the drive piece to enable a different size. the bits are pretty decent, and i have yet to have a problem, but the downsize bit snapped when trying to loosen a bolt. the ratchet holds up well surprisingly. i used it with an extension bar to get an oiled up sparkplug from my truck. despite a massive amount of tension on my part, the ratchet did not break. this would be a good set to keep in the garage for quick changes on a mower or compressor. i wouldn't recommend it for serious jobs.",1,112

"she hit a nerve, that's communication....duh......: before i learned here why i should have hated this book, i loved it and only wished it was longer. barabara didn't write this book to be literature, figure it out, she wrote it because nobody cares about this stuff anymore and nobody is writing about it or reading about it, they are too busy caring what celebrities are screwing other celebrities.i have lived in both worlds. one of the reviewers basically said, she should get a family or friends then high rent would not have been a problem. i have been through the roommate thing and would rather wander the streets than live with my family. some families are not helpful and some people simply have no support system. i know. i was one. men were my support system and i lived with some of them just to get by.she has courage and heart, and wrote her truth. most importantly, she wrote a book that is readable about a subject that usually reads like an encyclopedia.",1,173
voluspa tuberosa perfume: if you like the scent of tuberose you will love this. this slightly oily roll-on lingers on for an amazingly long time. it reminds me of wearing a lei in hawaii. this is the closest smell to the actual flower i have ever experienced.i'm not a rep for the product. i purchased it at a spa in san diego and wanted to know how to get more. i paid $30.00 for it.,1,75
"good but not great.: having grown accustomed to j.e. gardiner's splendid rendition of this work with the monteverdi choir and orchestra on the erato label, i must disagree with the other reviewer here and weigh in with a lesser rating for christophers and his ensemble. the tempi are comparatively breakneck at times, and the soloists generally aren't anywhere near the former's qualitative level. yes, the sixteen does avoid the common pitfall of taking the final chorus too slowly, but the recording overall fails to match both gardiner and parrott's performances in my book. in short, it's good but definitely not great",1,101
"wits n wagers: good product my family and i liked playing it. easy to learn, we took to many holiday parties. cute idea.",1,23
"christmas disappointment: my 9-year old daughter received the stvg-700 on christmas, and it was initially a lot of fun. that is, until about 15 minutes into playing with it when the onscreen monitor went black in the middle of the screen and you could no longer see the lyrics. it will have to be returned for another, which i hope doesn't have reliability problems. fun machine, but seems to have a reliability question mark hovering above it.",1,77
"in the ruins (book 6): although not quite as good as the previous five, it still rates a 4-star. it's frustrating, at times, as it does tend to drag on and on with little continuance. then it jumps to another set of characters to bring you up to date. there are so many scenerios, it's hard to keep track of them all, all the time. kate elliott is a fantastic author, and i will be patiently waiting a new series after book 7 comes out.",1,85
great mirrors: i attached these mirrors to my extended mirror for pulling our 5th wheel camper.these mirrors make it much easier to see around the camper and while backing.,1,29
"neil young & crazy horse - rust never sleeps - the concert film: if you like neil young, you will like this one. picture: 4 stars, sound: 4 stars.",1,29
"a glorious read: fascinating, hilarious, exuberant, and so keenly written -- i was disappointed when it was over, because i'd come to enjoy hanging out with the narrator so much. it's up there with eggers and burroughs as can't-miss memoirs of the ex-gen-x -- just great.",1,46
penlight: we love these lights and always order from this company who ships them right out. they have always had sufficient stock for the orders we place. great company to deal with.,1,32
"awesome!: this shoe rack is awesome! it fits perfectly in my walk in closet, and it was so cheap! it was easy to assemble and seems pretty durable!",1,28
"brilliant documentary: finally out on dvd, this is a terrific account of phil's life. my only regret is that there are really no extras on the disc - it would be great to see outtakes from the interviews and better still the whole live performances which go to make up the numerous clips shown in the documentary. i don't think that there is much unreleased studio material left at a&m or elektra but there seems to be a wealth of live performances as shown tantalizingly in this movie and readily found on you tube. it would be great if someone were to put together an archive release of his live work.",1,111
"mind blowing floyd!: in writing this review, i have focused purely on the music rather than the band composition and have not compared this to other albums. i think any album or compilation has to be taken in isolation and in this, dst stands out as an extremely well composed and engineered album. what i like about this album is its brooding and almost smoky feel, particularly when you listen to it on cloudy, rainy days, when you are just a bit blue and when you dont want something heavy going on in the background. pick this album, put it in your cd changer and let it loop, and watch the music grow on you. the soothing bass and the mellow guitating gets you going. get your rare scotch out and pour yourself a couple and let the heady combination take you to stratosphere!!",1,144
"great live set by the boss: in my humble opinion, this is the by far the best live set put out by the boss. it still holds up after almost 30 years. i wish it was available in dvd format. there is everything here from ""growing up"" to "" born in the usa"". a must have for any bruce springsteen fan!",1,61
"nice addition: its a nice small book, the type is easy enough to read and the paperback isn't an issue if you aren't afraid to bend the book. it has all the chords showing finger positions at the top of each song. most are quite simple and you rarely have to turn a page. the review about chords at the back is totally innaccurate.there are 2 christmas books in this series...this one and ""christmas carols"", which might be the one you are looking for.",1,84
"dcc-1200: a far superior piece of equipment to my previous coffeemaker, my only complaint (like others) is the small opening for adding water. it makes good coffee and keeps it hot.",1,31
"quit hatting on green day jealous punks: this album is a 90's masterpiece. i'm so tied of ""true"" punk fans that whine about green day not being punk enough. they combined perfect melody with fast punk riffs better than anyone. people will still be listening to this album 20 years from now.",1,52
"review: ghosts of the rich and famous: as with all mr. myers' books, this is a well written account of supposedly haunted dwellings -- in particular, those of famous folk. he draws no conclusions, which gives his tome an air of journalistic honesty. very interesting, somewhat spooky in places, and quite entertaining.",1,52
"perfect for grandkids: never had anything like this when my children were little. it's perfect for visits of my grandson. it's easy to set up, install and folds up into a small storage case when not needed. this is the perfect product!",1,42
"it's better than it looks!: this bag is much stronger than it first appears. it took a little finageling to get the tree in the bag, but once in, there is still room to spare. i put a 7.5' full size led prewired christmas tree in there and it was easy enough to relocate it in a storage area afterwards. the cost was $2.49/bag plus shipping, so for that price, i got two.",1,73
"songs are original, catchy, upbeat,and they know how to sing: summergirls caught my attention when it first came out, but i thought that their cd wouldn't be as good as the single. the songs are cute and they're catchy. they have really good voices and they know how to harmonize. very good cd, i would definately recommend it.",1,58
"kodak easyshare c533: i was so scared to buy my first digital camera and probably did more than anyone's share of ""research"" before i bought this, but it has been nothing but wonderful and so easy to use..amazon helped with any questions i had and it was shipped almost immediatley...i love it!!!!!!!",1,52
"my review: in this book, the eighth book in the niccolo series, nicholas is a changed man and he tries to right all that he has done wrong in the past. he is again faced with many obstacles, and his enemies as still out ""to get him"". he finds peace in the end but it also comes at a high price.i have given one less star for this book, because i think the author spends too much time in this book detailing scottish history when it is not the main subject. it is certainly interesting but, she could have done what she did for all the other countries, where she only gave us a brief summary that enabled us to comprehend the complexities of ""foreign policies"" during that period.i still have rarely enjoyed reading a hostorical novel so much. i was raised in europe, and always felt very familiar with the places, names and people. every scene was detailed and very entertaining and always the plot has been very well thought-out and very intelligent.",1,174
"very thin, works great: these work wonderfully. they are very thin--so don't drop one or you might not be able to find it. so far, they've worked fine with thread and yarn.",1,32
"beauty is a real gem: what makes this masterpiece speak for itself is the main ingredient none other than the tight harmonies flowing throughout this entire recording,infested with strong lyrics. ""attics of my life"",smoothly flows like a fine wine remenisant of the beatles classic,sun king. and so classic is as classic does in jerry garcia's signature tune,""ripple"",among other notable tunes ,""sugar magnolia"",""operator"",""friend of the devil"",""box of rain"". the tight instrumentation is subdued on this album leaving the vocals more room to stand out painting a visual in the listeners mind. another grateful dead classic,an essential containing sixteen remastered tracks,ten are of the original 1970 album,the extra six are live versions of,truckin',friend of the devil,til the morning comes,including a single version of truckin',superior audio. an american beauty.",1,126
"excellent book: an excellent book, with crisp clear photos in a simple reader friendly format. great for seeing what those plain fry are going to grow to look like. also useful in seperating breeds with similiarly marked females and juveniles. you can take this one off the bookshelf and leave it on the coffee table.",1,55
"a definite step up.: as standard definition tube tv's go toshiba has put together a nice one here. picture quality from a basic directv box is decent even when connected via standard coax cable. it is however, when you play a dvd connected through the componet jacks on the rear that the picture really jumps off the screen. the details are generally sharp and the colors are vibrant. (note: if you are upgrading from a smaller tv that doesn't have a 16:9 mode, you may need to adjust your dvd players output to maximize its benefits. you will still have the black bars at the top and bottom but they occupy significantly less screen area then i have been accustomed to.)i have been largely please with the setup features and overall performance of the set. my one gripe, small as it may seem, is that there is only one set of component jacks on the rear of the set. the second set is in the panel on the front.bottom line, if you are replacing an older tube tv then this set is worth a look.",1,185
"smooth shave: i still prefer triple slotted shavers and wish remington would bring one back. but, of several screen foil shavers tried, i've found this one provides the smoothest, most complete shave. cuts very well without having to go over areas several times. also, takes a great charge that lasts for several shaves without running slow. very comfortable to hold.",1,60

"winnie mae: ""over - produced"", my aunt ida! this book kicks major bootie, for kids & parent-folk alike! my local library should be so prudent, as to have this lusciously illustrated vignette in their collection (which they *don't*, but i intend to donate!). the author/illustrator is a true craftsman, & we can all benefit from his heartfelt philosophy.

book: the actually product/book was in great condition. i was very disappointed in the fact that i paid more to have the book shipped quickly and i did not receive the book within that time.,1,35
"amazing: i first heard this story in elementary school and fell in love with it. i bought it for my own child two years ago, and he loves it as well. it's a simple, fantastical story the appeals to all children, and a great way to foster imagination.",1,48

"whatever you do don't: ok, this is pretty much the only dive knife you'll get on amazon and not cry about losing it on the first day of use if you do of course. it's a nice dive knife, case is plastic and does have a push with one hand operation. the straps feel good around my lower leg. who cares if it lasts. nothing in salt water lasts anyways so to buy an expensive one would mean you got money to blow or your lacking something else. lol it could save your life so the cost goes well with the construction of it. i'm using it for a basic lobster dive snorkeling. hey don't forget to get a dive light too for those under rocks see! get one that has the 4 aa. ok i'm out! be safe!!! reply and i'll tell you which mind blowing dive light i got that is awesome! oh by the way i got the sharp point in green. if you drop it you can spot it quickly in dark waters. it has happened to me so many times i keep buying knives so like i said nothing lasts forever!",1,196
"what can i say but purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrfect!: this is the perfect blend of people, cats, and mystery. braun has gotten a style that is reminiscent of agatha christie and ellery queen while treating all of us cat lovers to two of the smartest cats on earth. all i cat say is don't start it until you can read it straight through because you will not want to put it down.",1,69
"excellent value.: when the battery that came with my canon camera stopped holding a charge, i was torn with spending a big chunk of change on a new canon battery or just shopping for a new camera that used regular batteries. i was so excited to find this generic battery at such a great price.",1,55
"great for 15 minutes a day: i think this is a great game and keeps your memory and thinking going.the program has some trouble recognizing the + sign i use for the quick math and often turns it into another symbol. since i can read music and play the piano somewhat already, the music portion is super easy. i also love the daily sudoku. overall a very fine game.",1,69

"by far my fave ac/dc!!!!: overall this is a great live cd, it contains most of thier best and most populer songs. however the album doesnt really stick to you. by this i mean most of the songs get old fast but, still it's a great cd for any kind of ac/dc fan.",1,53

"still scary!: this movie single handily ruined my babysitting career! it didn't matter that i usually babysat in single floor homes, or that they only had one phone / phone number attached to the house. the whole idea of that movied scared the crap out of me! in '79, i was 10 years old, (telling my age), and roughly the time i began to babysit.... wrong movie to see at that time!! lol! but i can't wait to see it again! :) by todays standards, people might say it's not scary or that it's just plain silly... give it a chance! it's one of the best supsense/thriller's i know of! by the way: have you checked the children????",1,118

"ferry at his finest: this is probably my third favorite bryan ferry cd, following ""boys and girls"" and ""bte noire."" it maintains the atmospheric production of those two cd's (this time courtesy of robin trower) and also ponies up with some great writing from ferry.the players all pitch in with great work. old roxy friends phil manzanera, andy mackay and brian eno contribute to most of the songs, along with notable musicians like maceo parker, nile rodgers and pino paladino. they all pile on rich, lush layers of sound, buoying ferry's timeless tenor. while ""mamouna"" is probably one of ferry's lesser known albums, i probably return to this one more that, for instance, ""taxi"" or ""frantic."" if you prefer ferry's work in the ""avalon"" era, then ""mamouna"" will probably be to your tastes.",1,133
"besides the holy bible, this is the best book ever written: the story of the stubborn mule is a southern classic and the funniest event ever put on paper.",1,29
"the best of world music: having just heard dima for the first time on the world music awards, i took a chance and bought his cd, sound unheard (except for the one song i heard during the awards). even though all the songs except that one are in russian, it is a very enjoyable disc! i would highly recommend it. his vocals are smoky, but pure and the sound of his singing in russian adds to the exotic feel of the music. i went ahead and bought a dvd of his, too (haven't received delivery, yet), since i enjoyed the visuals of his performance during that one song.",1,108
"halleluja to more diverse characters!: thank goodness harlequin blaze has finally opened up to more diverse characters. i too thought this interracial, until i read mia's review below. i've been reading this line, harlequin temptation before it, and other romances for years. i've always hated the segregation of these characters. and yes, i've read the books where the hero or heroine is 1/8th something -- just enough to call it 'exotic.' category romance has been the last world to be integrated. it's a good thing.",1,85
"pretty good, but kinda different: i just picked up this cd last night, and i think it is very good, it is alot lighter then i expected. it still sounds like a staind record, but don't expect the heavy guitars like on dysfunction. the song writing is very good. aaron's lyrics are awesome on this album. i think the best songs on the album are ""price to play"", ""zoe jane"" and ""how about you"", but all of the songs are good.",1,81
clay aiken is refreshing: i preordered clay's cd from amazon and i am so glad i did so. it is wonderful to hear such a clear and powerful voice. hopefully we will hear much from this new young talent. i live in the northern part of alabama and stores were sold out of this cd by tuesday night.,1,58

"i thought it would have a crappy ending: i really liked this book. i liked the characters and the story, but while reading it i figured it was too good to be true and prepared myself for a bad ending. very, very surprisingly it was a good ending, it made sense and it fit with the rest of the book. it made me feel all smokey and sultry and hollywood nocturne-y.",1,71
"absolutely beautiful!: susan mckeown is my step-cousin's husband's sister and i have been enjoying ""bones"" since before it was available in america. what can i say? i was amazed and moved by the entire cd. my particular favorites are ""albatross"" and ""snakes"". this is great music to listen to after a hard day or when you simply need to relax. don't miss it! note to stephen: thank you, thank you, thank you for giving me this music so long ago. i can't tell you how much i've enjoyed it!",1,89
very good reading!: everything is well explained. i recommend it very strongly to anyone interested in judaism. starts simple but by chapter 2 its heavily into orthodox with hardly a mention of conservatism!,1,33
"emotional and gripping: this movie held my attention from beginning to end -- it is so beautifully photographed, quite dreamlike, and the two main actors (huppert and greggory) give some of their finest work to date. the pair seem like the most perfect married couple, who live in a beautiful home, decorated with amazing art, and who love to entertain lavishly on a regular basis. that dream comes crashing down to reality when greggory finds a letter from his wife, stating she has left him for another man. all that being said, the film is far too short. one would think that there is much more of a story to tell, and so the ending is not very satisfying. i think of this more as a snapshot into the world of a very troubled relationship. despite my criticism, it is a gripping film and definitely worth seeing.",1,147
"great show when you cannot be there !: we have previously been to the radio city christmas show. we planned to go again this year with friends who never were, but had to cancel. however, our friends were able to see the show via the dvd. done well with high quality.",1,51
"i am crazy about albert hammond's ""your world, my world"": ever since 1989 when i listened to the tracks in this wonderful album, i have never heard anything better. i am so crazy about the lyrics. infact, one particular number,""now that you're gone away"" keeps reminding me of one particular girl i was so much in love with but lost somewhere along the line. my biggest worry is that despite my love for the album, i cannot lay my hands on one. please anybody who can let me buy one should let me know through my e-mail:fredochu@yahoo.com i am a nigerian journalist with one of the country's leading national dailies, ""daily champion"". anybody who lets me have this album would have given me one of the rarest opportunities and collection. is albert still alive? if he is, could somebody tell him that he is great. i look forward to having the album and i am prepared to pay the cost of it. fred chukwuelobe.",1,164
"view from a burning bridge: frances treadwell leaves new york city for the tranquility of maine in sarah goodyear's view from a burning bridge. unfortunately, it is ruined by the fall of a meteorite on her property and thus, ends the quietness of her life. goodyear has written a powerful, gripping and amusing story of relationships and the old saying of one can not go home again. this is an impressive debut novel.",1,73
"really great cd: i am a very big fan of alanis's supposed former infatuation junkie album because it didnt get much airplay and it wasnt overplayed like many songs off of jagged little pill. this album ranks higher than both of these...even the overplayed songs sound good. this cd is one of the best of all time in my opinion, i do wish she included some more songs off of junkie, though. no pressure over cappucino, joining you, and princes familiar are by far the best songs on the album. the live versions of you learn and that i would be good are also good because they are stripped of their fake drum beats. i would reccommend this album to anyone who is a fan of acoustic music.",1,128

"this book is a powerful account of materialism!: this book is a excellent read into a lifestyle beyond my scope. it also tells the tale of what becomes important in a young person's life is set by their family's values early in life. sister souljah has given us all something to feast on, a reason to pull together our families and communities and to reach out to each other. i couldn't put this book down for long, it was eventful yet a lesson in the message.",1,86
"canon 200eg camera bag/backpack: wow, fantastic product of very high build quality. you will not be disappointed with this unit. it is specifically built to haul cameras, lenses, cables, batteries, chargers and all the other goodies you need with room to spare! it's comfortable to wear as well...ventilated against your back, and has wide straps over your shoulders. highly recommend this oneb. light",1,63
"a must have for all andy fans: this video records an incredible evening from 1978 that allows the true professionalism and showmanship of andy shine. some of the on stage dialogue seems inconsistent with earlier or recent performances, but this was also 1978. his range comes through with modern hits (lifting me higher, you... ), and the west side story segment is 5 star. the magic of the video rests with the interviews... again, it was an incredible evening, and this is a must have for the true andy fan.",1,90
"excellent mob biography: it's very interesting to see how this extremely entertaining biography reads in comparison to the classic movie it served as the catalyst for. wiseguys is engaging. you really begin to feel as if you come to know henry hill and the various gumbas he introduces you to throughout the pages.if you've seen goodfellas you will certainly find the combination of certain characters from the book into one character for the movie interesting also. screenwriters will enjoy how martin scorcese altered aspects of the book to make the story flow on screen.many pieces of henry hill's dialogue were magnificently voiced over word for word in a brilliant performance by ray liotta. a credit to scorcese and liotta. many alleged ""gurus"" shun voice over in movies. but when used properly, as in goodfellas, the results are classic. and we wouldn't have that classice if it weren't for mr. pileggi documenting the life of henry hill here in wiseguy.",1,159
"roses meltin pot: over the past 300 years, america's table has been enhanced by countless immigrant cultures as well as her regional cooks. in her latest book, rose levy beranbaum, perhaps the most gifted cooking teacher in america, adapts many of these dishes for the american kitchen. as always, with rose's books, this one draws on her years of experience in teaching to explain in the clearest and simplist language how to make the most delectable and delightful foods with ease.chapters include: soups and appetizers, bread, main courses, side dishes, vinegarettes, sauces, stocks, brunch, desserts, beverages.",1,96
one word : awesome: i'll not comment on what is inside the book as we all know the book itself. i will only comment on the the way the book is published. paper quality is top notch in fact one of the top quality publishing i have ever seen. cover design and the picture is well choosen and it looks good. everything is perfect about this book. highly recommended.,1,69
texmark rechargeable portable pump: this pump is a great size and powerfull. it blew up a hi-rise twin bed in a couple of minutes.the only negative is the attachment nozzles do not lock on so i found they fell off easily.,1,41

"i loved this movie.: this is not a zombie movie but a warning about bio weaponry mistakes, but it was still good. i maen the way that they kept the stillness from the game in it. they kept the surprises too. the actors did great too. i hope that they make a resident evil 2 soon cause it would be great to see.",1,63
"the tale of religious grandeaur told marvelously!: this film is, what i consider, the best religious epic ever made. there is only one way to describe it: jennifer jones. this oklahoma girl shared her first major cinematic efforts and won the oscar for best actress of 1943. i cry every time i watch bernadette of lourdes' efforts to show her french town that she did envision the virgin mary. her performance is so rivetting that i was even saying to myself ""i believe you, jen. i do believe you!"" every thanksgiving i watch this film, i don't know why, it's just the perfect time for it. this tale is told through the very sensitive direction of henry king with simplicity, hope, and moral. this is a film for all ages, and really brings the true message of faith home.",1,139
recommended: nice novel-had a satisfying feel at the end. i liked that the main character cobbled together a living. lots of people put together a life in odd or disparate ways but you don't often find them in novels. i found this novel a convincing evocation of a certain kind of urban life.,1,53
"amazing camcorder: i used to have a sony dcr-vx2100, new fx7 is better in everything (well, low light performance almost). compact, easy to use with excellent picture output. bought directly from sony. do not think - buy and you will be happy!",1,42
"this is your bible if you have panic/anxiety attacks!: this is the very best book ever written for those suffering from panic/anxiety attacks! i could not face life without it! it covers everything about what panic/anxiety is, to how to deal with it, information to help to heal with meditation, diet, drugs, connecting your with higher power. great, great book! i also know of panic/anxiety support groups that use this as ""the book"" for information.",1,75
"dissecting the pile: the ""pile"" as is came to be known, was the rubble left behind by the collapse of the twin towers of the world trade center. a mess. a huge mess. the who's, what's, why's and hows are accurately discussed in this book about that mess--who took control of it, and what was done with it. a different look at ground zero and those who were thrust in charge of this unique operation. an insight at the interests of those who really had control of the ""pile""--the firemen, the police, and port authority police. a fine addition to the real story of 9/11.",1,105
"more end-to-end asp.net, less e-commerce: this is primarily a book about constructing an asp.net web site using stored procedures, and less a book about e-commerce. there are a few sections, mostly at the end, which are specific to e-commerce. these include the order processing pipeline chapter and the credit card transactions chapter.this is not to say the book is bad. it's very well written and the code is described step-by-step in detail. there could have been more emphasis on architecture, and a little more on e-commerce. i would also like to see some emphasis on the sticky legal issues like customer data management, password security, transaction security, and how and when to migrate the data off of the machines on the open internet and back into safe storage on the intranet.",1,131

"great surrounds: i bought these to be the surround speakers in my home theater system & definitely made a good choice. my speakers are all polk monitor series tied to an onkyo ht-sr875 receiver (also awesome). the thing that really stands out is how absolutely clear and pure the sound is from the polk speakers. when watching movies - the soundtrack sizzles and the dialogue is crystal clear. while watching the superbowl - i heard this funny popping noise coming from the opposite side of the room from me -and then realized i was hearing someone at the game, sitting by a microphone and applauding. clear as a bell.i don't think i would like these as well for a dedicated bookshelf stereo speaker - they reproduce mid to high range well, but don't have much bass response. paired with larger front speakers, a center channel and a good subwoofer, they help create a really terrific home theater experience.",1,158
"the most expected movie: i've been fan of the simpsons since i was 10. after 19 years of watch this great animated series i could not believe that a movie was comming.i was the fist in the row waiting in the premiere first presentation in the cinema when this movie was released.very good movie. just what i expected from mr. groening. even though it is such as long episode, it has the necessary material to provide good time for most of the viewers. it's not necessary to be a fan or even had see any episode before to enjoy it.my favorite character is homer! he rules!!!i've seen this movie several times in spanish and english, the same as the most of the previous 19 seasons of this ""lifestyle""if you are a simpson's fan, you must have this movie.",1,138
"sex music: this is basically background music for sex. excellently produced and mixed, e-smoove never loses sight of the album's direction, ie. sexual arousal. heavy bass, juicy, persistent tribal rhythms, some live sex thrown in; what more do you want? like he says on one of the tracks, it is 'highly contagious.'",1,52
"external hard drive: i have used this on a macintosh for 2 years. it is plugged into my computer, via usb cable, and i have scheduled weekly backups using apple's ""backup"" software, without any problems. i sent one to my son, who is in iraq and on a pc, to back up his laptop. the one downside for a laptop is it could drain power since it does not have its own power source. this hard drive lasted 3 months. after 3 months he got an error message. when he came home on leave, he took it to a computer tech who could not recover his pictures and music. amazon took it back and only refunded me 80% of purchase price and charged me with shipping. i was not pleased, and needless to say my son was very disappointed that he lost his files.",1,144
"loved the prose..: i love how simplistic this cover is. there really isn't much to talk about, since it is so simple, but i really, really think it has an impact.at first, i thought i wasn't going to be able to get into the poetry style writing of this, but after about 5 or 6 pages i found myself enjoying it immensely. despite the thickness of this book it is quite a quick read. the subject matter is heavy, but it is appropriate. the writing style adds so much to the story and pauses in all of the right spots. by now, i'm sure you are all aware of the story matter and i will just add in that it is powerful and raw. i give ellen hopkins very high praise for her ability to draw the reader into the story and take us on this journey with kristina/bree. i highly recommend this book--it will make you think for quite awhile.",1,161

"tremendous: a tremendous show. one of the best available on dvd. if you are a dead fan, this is an absolute must. face it, jerry and brent are dead, so the only way to see this era of the dead is on dvd, and how many times did you see them live in the first 10 rows, anyway? the sound quality is excellent, and some great versions of stagger lee, row jimmy, bertha, cold rain and snow and many others. get it, stop thinking.",1,84

"good fun: it's a fun game with some twist and turns that keep it interesting through out. it had a few weird things like wanting you to drink and smoke for good health and also to kill a child to gain more points. i did none of it and still enjoyed the game. i don't know why that added crap like that, otherwise it was fun.",1,66

"good entertainment, nice surprise: watched with some friends and we all agreed that especially for a sequel, the movie was very good in keeping with the flavor of the original.what so commonly happens is that multi sequels just keep adding more and more action,usually going way over the top.however mbi3 had the action and added heart !",1,57
"nifty laundry aid: my pink phillies ball cap was looking very grungy, but washing it by hand did not do the trick. someone mentioned to me that there were such things as ball cap washers that allowed you to wash your cap in the dishwasher, and i searched for one on amazon. this one was so reasonably priced and arrived in only a couple of days. it is designed to be used either in a washing machine or a dishwasher, but is not recommended for use in front-loader washing machines (which we have.) so in went the phillies cap with the next load of dishes, and amazingly, it came out looking almost new.ball cap washer - safely clean your cap in the washing machine or dishwasher (white) (12""h x 8.5""w x 4.5""d)what a nifty little plastic contraption!",1,137
"not just a 10, but borderline 11: simply put, the two towers is 33.3% of the best book ever. the others of course are the fellowship of the ring and the return of the king. some consider this as a trilogy, but its really just one long, awesome book. action, adventure, majik, different races.. everything to create an awesome work of literature is here. if you enjoy anything that has to do with science fantasy, trust me!! tolkien will be your favorite author on the subject.",1,86
high quality cable without the high price: this cable is solid and works well for me. i purchased this cable to connect my media pc to my sony 1080i crt tv. blu-ray movies look great and the image quality is clean. it was a cinch to use this cable to hook up my tv as an extended desktop for my laptop. the build quality is great at half the cost for similar cables at the local stores.,1,77
"incredibly fun: great toy! it was an incredibly fun to to play with, my dog loved it and it was really great to watch. however, it did not hold up very well against an aggressive player and the tree trunk was quickly in pieces. the squirrels fared a little better and one has managed to avoid total destruction for over a week.",1,62

"great sock with slight modification: this is essentially the same sock jc penny carried for years, but is now discontinued. the last pair i purchased was on close-out about a year ago. the only problem with these is as the prior reviewer noted with the binding top ring of the sock. a long time ago i figured out that simply cutting off the top 1/8"" solves this problem of binding and doesn't cause any unraveling with the jc penny socks. we'll try the same with these and see if it works as well, as i anticipate it will. great socks then for years of wear.",1,105

"almost perfect: i felt that boss of bosses was a great mafia book. if you enjoy the godfather then you'll love boss of bosses. i think my favorite part of the book was when the fbi had to plant a bug in castallano's house. the tricky part was that paul never left his house. one thing that was nice knowing, was that the authors were the actual detectives assinged to the case. this means it's true to life, no embelishing! one slow part in the book was the hours of tapes that were meaningless to the story that the fbi explianed. this is what kept me from giving the book five stars. i love hearing about mafia and this book was great for that. i knew i wasn't getting rumors i was getting the real scoop on things. i think everyone should read boss of bosses by andris kurins and joseph o'brien.",1,152

"excellent thermostat: i have been using one of these to control a wood furnace for several years now, and there is simply nothing better for the job. prior to this i had tried several other thermostats including a standard honeywell round, but none of them controlled the furnace with any accuracy at all (2-4 degree temp swing). this thermostat with it's excellent 'heat anticipator' circuit controls the wood furnace with no more than a 1 degree of temperature swing (unless you over-fire it of course). i am getting ready to install electric radiant floor heat on an inclosed porch, and this is the only thermostat that i am even considering using.",1,111

"for true nomeansno fans: the cover art is disturbing as usual, but par for the course to any true nomeansno afficionado.the first two tracks are the best--great riffs and songs that build in intensity and max out at the end--kind of like sex.the last track was annoying at first, but its true value becomes more apparent through repetitive listening. the two drum set combination is something you'll never hear anywhere else.its great to have a band that deals w/ real existentialist dilemmas in a manner that's inspiring--not depressing.",1,88

"birthday present: i have not responded to this request as this item was birthday gift for my son. i searched everywhere locally to find this item in bluray, but no one had it (at least not at your price). i just gave it to him and he loves it. will also be looking to purchase the next item in the series ""life"" in the future and i am sure i will be checking back with amazon. i can always count on you to have whatever i am looking for.",1,89
"a treasure!: finding these symphonies collected, remastered, and at value price- not to mention back in print- is truly exciting. krips proves himself a energetic and thoughtful mozartian, and the concertgebouw orchestra (especially the strings- what a lush and layered sound. wow!) is nothing short of amazing. these symphonies were recorded over different sessions in '72 and '73, but the transfers are warm, vital, and really generously show the depth of this great orchestra. a friend turned me on to krips' work just recently, and i must say that this set must share some space on the shelf with some of the greatest recorded mozart symphonies i have heard. a treasure!",1,111
"great option for certain motorcycles too: what i like about this product is that it can be mounted without modification to your vehicle, and it can be used on a wide variety of applications.the only negative i've noticed is that the mirror is susceptible to vibration -- but that may be due to my using it on a motorcycle...",1,59

"by surprise: picked this album up by chance...you know, never heard of them (can you beleive it...i don't get out much) i have heard much bantor of electronic industrial music since the days of infancy with ministry, skinny puppy, cabaret voltaire. that goes back a ways....just can't picture this vocalist, the voice is very familiar...something i heard in a different life. out on the dance floor, ""i can't find shelter in this world, i'm searching for an other world, where i'll feel safe."" brought me back to why industrial music, or ""epm"" can still be on the cutting edge, by far better than the dark goth scene. this band will get me out there to get their back catalog. check this band out..you may be pleasantly surprised.",1,127

"a little irish songbook: i got this book in kilkenny for 4.99 irish punts, about the same as the north american price. although there are only twenty-seven songs in this little volume, some of them are not to be found elsewhere. i have especially enjoyed playing the arrangements of follow me up to carlow and the parting glass in this book. the words to the song the lark in the morning herein are different from those of the singing of paddy tunny, a further illustration of the vigor and variation to be found in true folk music.",1,97

"a good resource: explained the methods thoroughly with quite a few examples. not as good as ""taking charge of your fertility"" by weschler though, that one was much better. it was a good supplement to taking charge of your fertility (tcoyf), explaining things a little quicker and in less information than tcoyf. there were also a lot of chapters comparing the benefits of natural versus hormonal birth control.",1,68

"dexter's love affair with mayhem !!: how about keeping dexter on the air ?i've always believed the writer and director's of this television show to have mastered the continuous plot needed in each episode to hold the interest of the viewers. we all know what's going to take place with each episode yet the fun is in the watching as dexter is his third party narrative, and his planning to kidnap the bad guy so he can continuously establish within himself, his love affair with mayhem. all of the episodes of all the seasons are great. some episodes are better than others depending on the plot. dexter as a whole is great. if you're a nut case stay away from dexter. but then i should say stay away from seinfeld if you're a nut case. come on showtime keep dexter around. it is good entertainment even though it's based upon mayhem.",1,151
"surprising movie: well, i'm not english, so i apologize for all the errors you'll find in this review. what can i say about this movie... i saw it several years ago, translated in italian (il deserto della paura)that's fantastic, what an atmosphere, what a suspance, and the actors are all inspired and well involved in the story. i recommend this to all the hunters of the world, eh eh eh!!! great anthony geary!!!",1,73

"beyond words.: in a catalogue flooded with realizations of ""the art of fugue"" on every keyboard instrument and for every other ensemble imaginable, including saxophone quartet, did we really need another string quartet version? for myself, i will be sending my other string quartet recordings of these pieces to the resale bin. the emersons bring to this music, as they bring to beethoven, shostakovich, webern, and bartók (or anything else they touch), a quality in which they really do exceed the possible sum of their parts: impeccable technical skills, agile intelligence, warm heart, infectious energy, and a breathtaking sense of ensemble. each individual voice breathes with an independence rarely achieved in performance of this work, and yet each seems somehow utterly inseparable from the others. definitely a performance to shelve with the keepers - just like any other recording by this remarkable band of musical brothers.",1,146
"the hippest new music around!: i love this music, it is so upbeat and fun! my kids and all my friends just love it too. this is the kind of music that attracts all age groups. i hope to see a lot more of this band in the near future.",1,50
the blue print album: without this gem the 90's music scene would have never been. it also can be said that new bands today are possibly just as influenced. back when the good music was solid and not solid gold.,1,40

"a sense-ational documentary!: for anyone who has ever wondered how the five human senses works, this is the tape to purchase! this film of the flagship series nova introduces a wealth of knowledge on seeing, hearing, feeling, taste, and smell. anyone who has seen anything educational program from the nova series, now on pbs across the nation, knows the quality of their documentaries. this tape is no exception. this film is highly recommended to anyone who is interested in exploring these five basic functions of the body, taken for granted everyday. a real winner, this video will not disappoint!",1,99
"very informative: i really got a lot out of his book. he tailors sleep shaping concepts to child temperment which proved very beneficial to me. the organization of the book is slightly confusing but forgivable- he is, after all, a doctor and not a writer. take the information to confirm what you might already be thinking; you are the parent and have wisdom for your child. i highly recommend this book.",1,71
"great dvd! like always!: i love yu yu hakusho, and as soon as this came out i bought it!there is only one flaw on this dvd though. if you perfer to watch it in japanese with subtitles, they messed the subtitles up on ""yoko's magic"" (a.k.a. ""a desparate kurama: a final measure""), so the first half of the episode has the introduction subtitle stuck at the bottom of the screen. this is the only reason why it lost a star from me. but to be really honest, if you watch the english version, then go back and watch the japanese, it doesn't make a lot of difference ^_^the final round, the fight between team urameshi and team tugoro, is finally beginning, and the battle between karasu and kurama is the most beautiful fight in the world, so this is still definately worth buying. don't miss out on this great action in yu yu hakusho!",1,154
"an action-packed piece from beginning to end!: independence day was my first soundtrack by david arnold and it didn't take more than a minute to become a david arnold fan. from the beginning, the music is brooding and eerie, foreshadowing the appearance of the massive alien ships. once the aliens fire the first shot, all hell brakes loose as the action becomes rapid and intense between the good and bad. after very beautiful patriotic music, the battle continues for the final time, ending with victorious and extremely patriotic music. listening to it makes you proud to be an american and human. i recommend this highly to first-time david arnold fans.",1,110

"not bad at all...: pretty nice product. i don't have a lot of experience with ""regular"" kettlebells, so it is tough to do a direct comparison, but this set up works pretty well so far. it does seem to have the feel of regular kettlebells. i haven't gotten to really heavy weights, so can't comment on how bulky it may get with bigger weight loads. the construction is solid, but i would agree with a previous review that it seems a bit expensive for what i would think it would cost to make. it does look like it will last a while. buying or finding standard weights is not a problem, they are fairly cheap and can be found at yard sales, craigslist, ect. overall, as it has allowed me to start and progress through 2 levels of weights, and the money i have spent on the handle and weights is still less than what i would have spent on buying a starter bell and then having to trade up.",1,170
"outstanding: this book was a point where my view of the world has changed, shaped, made more sense and it opened a new dimension of the geography. fascinating to read and very well written, jhk comes up with a clear cut and realistic approach towards life in general and city life in particular.",1,53
"good book but what about the others?: bonnie bryant has been my favorite author and once again she has out done her self. the book was good but she( bonnie bryant) should have the other characters suchas maxi,veronica,and other people around the barn? the book is great and i'm definetly going to continue reading the series!",1,56

"for indoor workouts: when it is too cold to ride the trainer is perfect for your fix. i love my cycle-ops wind trainer because it allows me to get a good workout whenever it rains etc. it is relatively quite as well as being easy to fold up and put away. the bike fits easy with the built in skewers that lock perfectly without coming loose no matter how hard you hammer the pedals. you will feel confident locked in because it is very stable. the video is a little cheesy and i only looked at mine once or twice when i bought it. the girl and guy are just too darned happy, meanwhile i'm going through pain and grimacing trying to keep up with them. if you are into spinning you can spin away and never leave the comfort of your home. all in all it is a good accessory to have if you are a dedicated cyclist.",1,159
after a couple of days my tennis elbow was gone: odd as the exercise sounds and as odd as the simple device seems to be. it worked. within 3 days i was no longer hurting from tennis elbow. keep doing the exercises though. don't make the mistake of stopping just as soon as the pain goes away. later on if you think it is coming back than go do those exercises again. so glad my boss told me about it.,1,80

"exquisite writing: killing mister watson is a masterful retelling of a mostly true piece of history from the lawless everglades. peter matthiessen recreates the characters and families that participated in the killing, which was perceived as a necessary evil to rid the community of a vile man. his writing is immediate; his telling creates the scene and pulls the reader into the necessity of killing mister watson. it is fine reading.",1,71

"liked it more than judi: judi did not care for this movie...even said in her book she was in it just to play michael's wife...which she didn't! lol. good movie, good mystery...michael williams was fan-freaking-tastic, as always.",1,37
"so far so good: shipped promptly and arrived as it appeared on the web site. it is well made and has good layout and storage. i think a year of use is about the right time to evaluate items like this, so like the title says, so far so good.",1,50
"it really is that simple: having had the pleasure of hearing robert speak on numerous occasions, i was a little disappointed that his eloquent style was not forthcoming in this book. that aside, the information contained within is first class. as one who has been applying these principles for several years now, it really works. congratulations robert for using the leverage of books to reach a broader audience with your excellent material. i'll have to place my order for cashlow asap...",1,81
"great workout: i've only used level one so far. i love it. i have 30 day shred; shred it with weights; burn fat boost metabolism; and no more trouble zones. this (and shred it with weights) are the only 2 where i haven't made it past level 1.this workout works the entire body with lots of focus on the abs. planks, standing ab work, floor work and cardio all in one workout.",1,72

"the judgment of paris: the revolutionary decade that gave the world impressionism: an excellent review of french history in the 1860's & '70's. the extraordinary influence artistic styles had on society, and conversely political events which dictated the emergence of fresh, new art. easily read and enjoyed!",1,47
"4 stars for customer service... 2 stars initially: i bought this book initially for the panoramic project. come to find out that the .swf file did not work. looked on the web site, and at the time, there was no corrected file. i was disappointed because i was going to apply technique to a project at my job.then...i wrote to newriders and they referred me to matthew david, author of this book. he has helped me out and files will be uploaded on the newriders site shortly.whenever you can get a source .fla from 2advanced, which was a nice surprise, definitely worth the price... yes, a tute from 2advanced.",1,109
"the book of lists for teens: the book of lists for teens is an entertaining read for teens of all ages. the book address issues from dating to dealing with racism. sometimes the advice is serious; others are just plain silly. i like the variety in this book although some lists are more interesting and useful than others. this book gives the readers a lot of miscellaneous facts - perfect for those who love trivia! if the reader is reading this for the first time, my suggestion is to skip around - reading it back to front is dull, and some subjects simply may not interest the reader. all in all, a book worth checking out!",1,116
glissjr: i just love the purchased of the cast iron to cook cornbread. it is especially great with the two handles. you will not regret making this purchase. i am 100% satisified.,1,32
"what a great book!: this book by marsh collier is as about as good as it gets. it is easy to understand. though the book was written a few years ago, all of the information is still relevant. a few of the tools, etc. that are listed and described are revised on ebay's site, but the changes are rather minor and her how-to lessons are perfect. i highly suggest anyone wanting to buy and/or sell on ebay purchase this book. a++",1,81
"promising sci-fi series: i thought this got off to a good start. the hook here is that the public is for the most part completely deluded by these beautiful aliens carrying gifts (think of the trojan horse updated) while only a few suspect that they are covering up their real looks and intended deeds. the beauty factor, the free medical care and cures, the free gadgets and gifts, this all opens up some interesting story lines about people's weaknesses. i think this series will either get really, really good from this point forward or it will get terribly cliched and go straight down the tubes.",1,105
super fast shipping!!: the item arrived in almost a day from the order and is exactly as described. i knew the item would be longer than i wanted but it is still a quality product. i would order from this vendor again.,1,42
"amazing: i fell in love with every song by the time it started. this album is a must have. no matter what kind of music you're into this album will satisfy you. natalie did a great job with this album, i love it. since this is what her first cd sounds like i wonder how great her 2nd one will sound. its awesome you gotta go pick it up and hear it for yourself!!",1,74
saxon kickin': if your a fan of saxon add this to your cd collection. it's a cd/dvd combo. the clarity of the dvd is amazing. it's just like you are front row at the show. under rated band to say the least. they rock hard for sure. saxon is like motorhead to me. i don't think either band has a bad album !!,1,63
"helpful book: we recently remodeled a bathroom, and this book saved us time and frustration. when our first attempts at sweating copper pipes failed, we looked to this book and found very thorough instructions on each step of the process. the information on different types of solder and flux with a wider working temperature range was especially valuable. as a result, our next attempt with the copper connections was successful. the section on installing a pedestal sink was very clear and helpful, as was the information on choosing a toilet. the book also helped us diagnose and solve a problem with water hammer. i am sure that we will use this book as a resource for our next plumbing challenge.",1,120
"atrocious: when you hear leftist mit professor noam chomsky talking about ""the deadly effect of us-imposed sanctions on iraq,"" you squirm a little, wondering. then you read many credible sources citing the death of over one million innocent people (including some 5oo,ooo children) as a result of these sanctions. this makes you cringe a little more, but you still wonder about the reality of it all. although this book does not furnish any photos of children with one mutant eye bulging out their head from exposure to depleted uranium radiation, it does nonetheless paint an accurate picture of the current situation. (btw, i was exposed to footage of ""dumpster babies"" and mutant children in japan, so you can take my word when i say that you wouldn't want to see such photos anyway.) moreover, the book will provide you with the most up-to-date information about the sanctions available in print. if iraq, biological warfare or sanctions are issues that interests you, this book is not to be passed up.",1,169
"awesome book: i had never heard of this book before my son received it as a gift. he was about 9 months old and would insist that we read it again and again. he is now 4.5 and still likes it. and his little brother has enjoyed it just as much. the illustrations are fantastic and its fun to search for marvin on every page. i highly recommend this book. i also love the language - it uses fantastic, descriptive words. my soon was 2 and used the words mesmorized and exhilarating because he learned them from this book.",1,99
"i thought it was good, now i know its great: if it was you is a different sound for the girls from vancouver. this cd is quite different from previous offerings from tegan and sara. at first i was a little put off by the ""rock"" sound that blasted into my ears when i was expecting a folk acoustic soound. upon listening to this cd multiple times i have come to really appreciate it. the rock edge is done well and live these two really are absolutly brilliant. pick it up, listen to it a few times and you will find it just might be one of those cds that don't leave the player very often",1,116
"very inspirational,as the truth often is.: this truth shall set you free.i would recommend this to everyone that is searching for the truth about who we truly areand how we should behave towards each other and ourselves.",1,37
"uncommon reading about uncommon industries: uncommon carriers is an uncommon book, but then that is what one should expect from john mcphee. this is the third of his books that i have read, and all have been rather quirky. in uncommon carriers, mcphee investigates the behind-the-scenes world of transportation. he does this, not by doing research, but by actually participating in the transportation activities. the up side to this is that the reader gets an inside view of the often hidden world and an appreciation of the complexity that surrounds ways of life that may seem rather blasé to those not in the industry. the down side is that mcphee sometimes gets so deep into the vocabulary of the industry that he loses the reader. because of this, some of the segments are more accessible than others. but all are fascinating and eye-opening.",1,143
"great peaks, no troughs: the opening track's a gem - once heard, never forgotten, and probably danced to. has the stamp of blues standard all over it, in a rollicking jimmy reed sort of way. over nevada is a real rarity - try finding it anywhere else - and it's fab. like a long lost patti page single, and a good one. anders osborne's track is quite tasty, and the rest is less memorable but always at least pleasant. as a whole, it hangs together very well as a rootsier package than the movie would suggest.",1,96

dense and complex: this work is dense and complex; i'm still hopeful the reward will be commenserate.,1,17
"a great album.: my favorite two songs are ""don't look back,"" and ""lessons in my life."" i used to love ""de ha fi get a beatin,"" until i discovered the earlier version on arise blackman arise. i loved that version until i came across the original on the complete wailers 67-72 vol. 9 ""freedom time."" that one has the original ""steppin razor,"" and ""burial.""",1,64
"a must buy: nice cd.....all songs except a few r good and meaningful....broken and home stand out ....home has got great lyrics ""in my eyes u c the pain/with each lie i take the blame......""buy it its a must if you are into rock with emotional lyrics...overall this cd is a 5 on 5... they could hav got better songs than soulfire and back up....these songs r jus ok....running outa pain is a good emotional song...the way i feel is another senti song which gets kinda hard in the verse ..""coz i hate the way i feel tonight and i know i need you in my life...."" ...paul walker has done an amazing job with the vocals but the bass and lead guitaring is so so compared to other bands like element 80 etc. also get let go by 12 stones from the album daredevil",1,145
"all the right moves!: john argue's movement program for reduction of degenerative parkinson's disease symptoms is relatable and accessible, allowing almost any general reader to put it into action. tangible images for movement like the ""horse"" posture and ""picking up a baby"" give readers something to latch onto that will help them mentally and physically integrate the movement. the disease in question, elements that can cure it, and the dynamics of how patients cope with it are incredibly complex - yet argue manages to deliver beneficial commentary on all three consisely, compellingly, and even joyfully. in addition, the hope in his tone is just as important for patients in healing as the exercises he delivers. for all of these reasons i highly recommend this text for any parkinson's disease patient or carer seeking alternative, yet conclusively effective, methods for stemming the progression of this disease.",1,145
padre pio the true story: bernard ruffing is excellent. i have read this book more than once and have given these books as gifts to help people get to know padre pio and become his spiritual child. you can't go wrong buying this book and you will benefit spiritually by becoming closer to god and his great saint padre pio. highly recommended.,1,62

"an average or above average score: nothing too exciting here. most tracks are dreamy and sleepy. pleasant to listen to.i would buy this if already own some of rachel portman's other (superior) scores including cider house rules, the human stain, and emma (in that order).",1,45
"well-written and riveting...just not liking the end: someone advised me to read angels & demons first, before starting the da vinci code. dan brown weaved a very clever and intricate tale, combining fact and fiction well. i was completely enthralled with the book until the final 100 pages, as the culprit was being revealed. i felt that the story went from a thrilling mystery to a soap opera. i felt let down; almost like a cop-out. based on the ending, i would've only given it 3 stars but i still want to acknowledge brown's imagination for creating such a novel. i'm hoping the da vinci code is better.",1,108
"a classic, sort of: this debut lp from penetration is hard to pin down. it has punk elements (evidenced by covers of the buzzcocks' ""nostalgia"" and patti smith's ""free money), but had a sound closer to new wave. the songs are consistently strong, but rarely as brilliant as the best groups they emulate. the band avoids cliches of romantic, commercial rock, but the lyrics have never been particularly strong or innovative.moving targets doesn't exactly capture the band's live electricity, but is a competent rendering of the penetration at their most creative and consistent. the vocals of pauline murray solidify and give distinction to the sound. best of all, you can still listen to these songs long after other bands have become passe.",1,122
"great value!!: came quick, works amazing and for the size of this bottle which is bigger than anything in the stores it's a outstanding price!",1,25
"great electric mower: this is a great mower! lots of people have already reviewed the positives, so let me focus on something i didn't see in the reviews.this mower needs 12 or 14 gauge extension cords. the limit, according to the owner's manual, is 75 feet. this means you are limited to mowing relatively small lawns. or you can ignore the ""advice"", use 16 gauge wiring (this is usually the 100ft cords you can buy everywhere) and take your chances on shortening the life of the mower. or you can connect whatever length of 12 or 14 gauge and press on.my suggestion is to figure out the furthest distance you need to mow from a power outlet and make sure you can reach. or buy the cordless mower",1,128
"it works!!!: i chose this rating because the video works and there are no problems with it. the case it came in however was a bit beat up.yes, i would recommend this to my friends.",1,35
"among my favorites: it's hard to find a book that can keep its pace quick and interesting, delve deeply into human behavior -- in this case, court behavior -- and still give you enough information that you don't miss the first book at all. that is, i read this book without reading crown duel and i didn't regret it -- it gave me enough information that i didn't need to read the first book. it's also usual that a sequel will just recap everything from the first book in a rush of summary that leaves the reader's head spinning. here, everything is gradual and well-explained, and old characters are not thrown at you as if you know them. it's ... fresh, young, and moves fast enough to keep the reader wanting more.all around, there are few books i have enjoyed as sincerely or thoroughly as this one.",1,147
the hungry ocean: this book is so well written that could not put it down. it took me on the adventure with the fisherman. i hope linda greenlaw will continue to write more books. great job! look forward to your next series.,1,42

"a middle man tells his story.: swofford is part of a marine sta, so he is not just some grunt at the bottom complaining about serving his country, and he's not a general telling you about all the decisions he has to make and why with all the little details. swofford shows you who he is and tells an amazing story using the war in iraq during the first gulf war as the linear part of the story, cutting in to tell the story of his life. why he joined, his family, his girlfriends, and about the marines (the real marines) and the difference between trained to kill and warrior. jarhead is a great book and by middleman i am referring to him being above his fellow marines in combat skill, but not in control.",1,135
"a beach favorite!: this book has romance, wit, mystery, and suspense. what more could you ask for? i devoured this book at the beach. it kept me in suspense the whole time. luckily, i leave in sunny florida, which means that i am able to read at the beach all year. this is an awesome summer read. get name dropping today!",1,61
"very well written: as an owner of 4 other php books, i have no qualms in saying that this book is undoubtedly the best one of the bunch. gilmore's book covers a vast assortment of topics important to every php programmer, and provides quite a few great examples. the great aspect of this book is that it serves as both a reference and a means for learning new php programming methodologies.if you're debating over which php book to buy, this is it.",1,82

my teeter hanger for my ankles: the unit came on time and complete transction went very well. the unit does was it expected but i believe it is a bit difficult to use if your back it not well. the angles of bending required are extreme for someone with a bad back. they did allow my sore ankles from the cross bar to heal. there are too many moving parts to complete the closure.for folks in good shape just doing maintance then you should be handle it with no issue. very safe and secure with no issues.,1,97
love it: for the price i paid it was with it. i had family visiting and they said it was comfortable and easy to fill up and deflate. they are now going to purchase one because of it's convenience and comfort,1,41

"no defense: i am a big-time football gamer and this game is terrific. i am a little frustrated though at the inability to play defense. typical games are shoot-outs. a balance of offense and defense is essential in football games. this one lacks that. the graphics are phenomenal and the game is fun, but defensive minded football gamers will be disappointed.",1,61
"spiritually healing: this cd is absolutely beautiful! very healing, spiritually. her voice is just amazing.i bought so many copies of this cd & gave them to friends who, like myself, have been on healing journey's - physically, spiritually & emotionally..each one of them has loved it as much as i do! i truly hope she plans on making more cd's of this type.i just cant say enough about this cd. it's exquisite!",1,72
"fun family game!: even for younger kids that struggle with the regular csi game. this one has a lot of variety and is not like the others at all. you don't even really have to solve the crime! just following the different challeges to advance on the board is enough! blindly feel to identify ""bugs"", sketch pictures that others try to name, act scenes out for the others to guess, answer csi related trivia (some easy, some more difficult). we had a blast with this game and is now a family fave!",1,92
"some like it hot: a fine selection of rockabilly. my favorites include sammy masters' ""pink cadillac"" and ""some like it hot,"" featuring the fantastic guitar of country-jazz telecaster-master jimmy bryant. ""toodle-oo"" is another sweet tune, with guitar wiz eddie cochran burning the frets. also, pat cupp's great songs are here as well, including the title tune, ""lone gone daddy."" most of pat's songs star johnny gatlin, his wonderful guitar player. don't be fooled by the geeks on the cover, this cd is some hot bop, oooh mama!",1,87

"totally unique: this album is just worth getting for one song--the gift. the album is great, don't get me wrong, but if youre reading this review its probably because you have heard of way out west before. youll get the original mix of the gift in this c.d. a totally awesome song that mixes the beauty of the female vocals as well as the brightest and most energetic sounds that youve ever heard.",1,73
the gold coast cure really works!: four of my friends and i ordered the gold coast cure on the recommendation of a fifth friend. we couldn't put it down. we call ourselves the gold coast girls! the book explains everything so simply and i have never found an eating/exercise plan so easy to follow. what i noticed first was that the water weight i carry in my hand and feet disappeared. i feel lighter and so much healthier. i retooled my pantry and my entire family jumped on board with me. the changes in our diet were really easy to make because they did not seem drastic. the kids love the soy nuggets. i can't believe such simple changes in my diet made such a difference in how i feel every day. i have so much more energy. it feels good to feel good!,1,144

"brutal and powerful: when a friend recommended this novel to me, about a year ago, i didn't have very high expectations. i thought that it would be a very sensational and sappy story like so many war novels that never quite capture the true grittiness and tragedy of war. but i was really blown away by this effort that is honest, powerful, and captivating with its brisk prose and developed characters. definitely worth picking up!",1,75
"great movie!: i recently bought this dvd for my partner. we sat down and watched it 2gether. the story is about a young boy and his family, in some parts of this movie it can be a tear jerker. this movie will touch your heart, if you purchase it you wont be sorry. this movie has feeling.",1,57
just stunningly beautiful: the choirs of brigham young university must be one of the best-kept secrets in all of choraldom. i differ from the reviewer who felt that the sound quality of this recording is marginal; i believe that must be due to his listening equipment. when i listen to the sounds that waft from this disc i am melted into the couch.,1,63
"this is their hardest album yet: you really get a full band feel throughout most of this album and they add horns to many of the tracks as well. the only problem with this album is that it is their longest and features the most amount of songs that are longer than their trademark of under 3 minutes, even 2 minutes. there are a number of songs on here that are longer than 4 and some that just feel longer. at a certain point it just feels as if the album has stayed past its welcome. i'm not sure if it does. i like this album because it shows the influence of grunge on a few tracks while also staying true to the stylistic flipping from song to song that they are known for. you might not make it through the entire album in one sitting, but it's still high quality.",1,151
"way cool: this is one of the most exciting, most musical brass recordings you will find. these bone players obviously had a terrific time making the recording - just wait until you hear their version of clapton's layla!",1,38

"a disturbing movie to someone with ptsd: i have ptsd. i've locked out large chunks of my childhood. i first saw marnie when i was 17. it didn't knock my repressions loose, but it certainly stirred them up. i saw it again when i was in my forties, and i was recovering my memories. it knocked my socks off again. this movie would probably play completely differently to someone with a different history from mine. but it really hit it for me, and all those years when i was holding things down, i think it let me know that i was not alone.",1,103
"hours of fun and learning: a family member bought this for my 3 year old son and, at first, i didn't think he would be able to play it without constant supervision. to my surprise, he plays with the puzzles for an hour and does not get bored with them. and, it is fun to play with him as well because some of the puzzles are even challenging for adults. all in all, a great toy!",1,76
"one, two, three, four, five.: this recording is human and good in a removed or distant manner. in this way it has a ""man who fell to earth"" vibe of observational detachment. i will take another chance and also describe it as ""numb psychedelia."" it made me want to stop using conjunctions in speech, like a robot.",1,57

"john does it again but even better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: john's first novel really moved me with its intimate detail and personal family feel. but this new novel had my head spinning and my tummy doing flip flops. there was so much action and adventure that my head was whirling around, but the warmth and strength and human-ness (if that's even a word) of the characters made me feel part of a great spiritual journey. the story seemed so real to life in the crazy and frightening world we live in but the john's new book shows that tenderness, faith, hope and, like jesus said, most of all love, will conquer all evil and darkness ... thanks for making me believe in enduring and death defying love john!!!!! your words are wonderful!",1,129
court this book cause it is the best: i loved it i loved it i loved it!!!!!!!!! by far this book was the best of them all. full of action romance and fun it was a book couldnt put down. it gave me new faith in star wars books after reading the truce at bakura.,1,55
"fine recovery: jane and the stillroom maid is a nice comeback from the disappointment of the fourth installment in this otherwise spritely series. unlike jane and the genius of the place, the reason for the servant's odd dress isn't obvious from the very first. indeed, i found myself being constantly surprised. you won't guess ""who done it"" until you're told in the very last pages.as with all the jane austen mysteries, you'll find yourself enjoying the style and historical footnotes as much as the mystery itself. ms. barron has mastered imitating the voice of restoration ""ladies"" books and scrupulously researched the customs of the early 19th century. i felt a little thrill when she alluded to the customs of mourning and ""half-mourning.""lovers of jane austen won't be disappointed, of course. but neither are mystery lovers who want something a little bit off the beaten path.",1,145

"first sewing machine - amazing: learned how to use this within 20 minutes... i sewed a crib skirt and will be doing a quilt, bed skirt and valance soon. highly recommend.",1,31
"one of the best of hollywoods actors can also write!: the wonderful thing about this book is that absent the many famous names, it would still be a great read. though trying for some to admit, this was a brilliant man. his powers of observation and wit plus great talent for spinning a yarn make this a good book even for people who don't like films.",1,66
hdmi to hdmi cables 10 foot long: i got two hdmi to hdmi cables including shipping for less than $6. can't beat it and they work great. just outstanding!,1,29
uhh...: whoever says dallas' vocals/lyrics suck on this cd should stop listening to music. everything about this cd rocks. get it now if you can afford it.,1,27
"a classic in my book: i love this album to death, it's one of those that i could never get sick of no matter how much i listen to it. i think ever song holds up very well, there's no filler here. the music is dark yet beautiful and the lyrics range from depressing to uplifting. ""staring at the sea"" or ""galore"" would probably be a better introduction to the cure but aside from compilations, this is their best album in my opinion.",1,83
"a nice change of pace.: this is by no means a strong tea, it was not meant to be. the flavor is great. i normally make my tea from scratch but have these around when i am on the run. the price is very reasonable and i will certainly be purchasing more. for something a bit different, i certainly recommend you give this tea a try.",1,66
"great product: this was a gift for my brother and he was so soprised when he opened it, now he uses it all the time and it works so fine nice audio quality and it was a very good price and shipping time.",1,43
one of the best albums i've heard in a long time: this is hip hop in it's purest form...excellent production and tight lyrics (with substance!!). very feelgood album that i would recommend if you're a true hip hop fan.,1,39
"tai chi and shaolin, a deadly combo: eagle han plays a ming lord planning to bring down shaolin temple and rule china. two young students one from shaolin and another a student of tai chi join forces to stop him before it's too late. the two young men find out that they have more in common then they ever imagined before, and that they were more closely connected to the evil killer then they would ever have wanted. breath taking fight scenes, great drunken staff showcased, and some great tai chi kung fu aswell. eagle han is again a great villian. gotta see this one.",1,105
"great for the home when you dont have time for the gym: i got this exact product more than 2 years ago from marshall's. i still use it. you have to use the air pump they give you with it. it takes time to pump it up but it does get big. i pump it the size, they have at my gym, lucielle roberts. my trainer at luicielle roberts also showed me different ways to use the ball besides what they teach you on the dvd. you can also youtube different things to do with it. ha ha, i even try belly dancing moves on it too!",1,107
"brothers gibb: they have done it again! i really liked this cd! to me they are like a fine wine, they get better with age! i hope they continue to put out execellent cd's like this one! some say the bee gees are a thing of the past, i think they should hear the future!",1,55
::sigh:: not as good as it use to be: this album is definitly not as good as the old ones. island in the sun is a really good song. but the rest of the album sounds about the same. it's weird because you can just tell which one of the songs they're going to put out as singles and which ones are just going to blend around. the blue cd was a much better one. go back that one and ask your friend to burn this one for you.,1,89
"amazon exclusive: this is an amazon exclusive and won't be sold in stores. amazon worked out a deal with nickelodeon to ""burn on demand"" meaning upon receiving an order that amazon will create the dvd and insert then ship it to the buyer...i've been waiting a long time for hey arnold episodes on dvd, so heres another reason to luv amazon!",1,61
"interesting, dough a bit gullible by time to time: the courtship of princess leia is a combination of a true star wars plot with a walt disney farytale. i trully enjoyed this book except the part where luc is reborn despite he that he got killed",1,46
"a must have for your mountain bike: whether you have a shiny new mountain bike or one that has been on more than a few trail rides, this book is a must to have in your collection. for about [price] and the price of some tools you'll be able to perform the most common maintenance on your bike yourself. not only will this save you money (tuneups aren't exactly cheap these days), but you'll understand your equipment much better and be able to handle unexpected situations on the trail.the book is a large format with two columns of text per page and hand drawn figures (basically no photos). each part of the bike is covered in great depth in pseudo-outline form.the only downside is that the figures can be a bit difficult to understand. i can see how they can be more clear that photos, but some combination of the two or perhaps just more figures would have helped. i've found it is always best to look at the figures alongside my bike so there is no ambiguity.",1,178
"good but not great: i read the reviews and thought this video would have some groundbreaking report but it only really proved that o'reilly is an ignorant, noisy, bigot and that fox news has a political agenda, which can be said for cnn. even though, i can't watch faux because they're hypocrites. i wouldn't call this video revolutionary. it is worth the watch if you don't think fox's views are extremely skewed.",1,72
"almost perfect: i've loved these songs since early childhood, so it was a particular delight to find this nearly perfect recording many years ago. sioned williams's harp playing is just right and, despite modern misgivings about marjory kennedy-fraser's approach to the traditional songs of the scots highlands and islands, the arrangements are truly beautiful. lisa milne's voice is lovely. my only beef is that a very formal voice singing traditional song -- however beautiful the voice may be -- tends to sound unnatural and over-produced. that being said, this is a charming addition to my collection, and i recommend it warmly.",1,101
"spanish verb conjugation: fantastic book! very complete, easy to use and educational. i recommend it to anyone trying to learn spanish, from basic to advanced.",1,25
"joanie's first: one of the most unique pop/jazz voices ever as displayed on her first album. hard to believe she was only 18 years old at the time. the voice of the ""for those who think young"" pepsi commercials of the early '60's, i never tire of listening to her. we should be so lucky as to have other joanie re-issues.",1,61

"guitar delights from the philippines: tipanan - a celebration of the philippine guitaryoung filipino guitarist florante aguilar presents a delightful programme of popular music from the philippines, some traditional, some well-loved popular music from the middle of the 20th century, and some more modern items of his own composition. don't expect classical fireworks, just simple relaxing melodies played beautifully with great sensitivity. the more modern items are, to me at any rate, not so pleasing as florante's interpretation of the older melodies and traditional music, very little of which is known outside of the philippines. with his consumate musicianship and most attractive demeanour florante makes a fine ambassador for the music of his homeland, and deserves to be known much better outside the philippines.",1,124
four slot watch box: i have some watches that are in the 49 to 50 mm range and i am able to put four of them in this case. it's a nice looking case with a strong zipper to keep it closed. i recommend this case highly if you have watches that are 50 mm and below.,1,57
"a girls survival through disaster: as you are lead through the book, you may see what you don't want to see. it is as if you were there, engaged in this struggle to live through the dustbowl. as this little girl has to deal with disaster at such a young age, so did many, and most of them got through it the same, by hope. you might think the real struggle would be her with her environment, but what she finds out is that the struggle is really between her and her heart and mind. after the ""accident,"" all she has left is her father, not even her piano, which deserted her along with everything else. does she escape? will she survive? find out by reading ""out of the dust,"" by karen hesse.",1,133
"looks great: this is a very neat dress watch. i recommend it, despite the comments below. it is a bit smaller than i expected, but was very good value. i may look for something a bit chunkier for sporty outings. the hands and date are easy to read despite the plain dial. the quartering on the dial looks good. i managed to adjust the timne and date without reading the instructionsdifficulties? i struggled to adjust the strap - you need a screwdriver and a good grasp of engineering and the manual is not much use. i initially got the clasp on backwards and also had a lot of difficulty closing the clips. then when i had the strap the right length i found it quite hard to do the bracelet up. if you buy this (and i hope you will) do practice over a table and do not have the strap very tight - it won't do up like that.",1,160
"a great find: i have read many books on parenting. this is one of the best. although written for a group, it is also very good if you are reading it on your own. this is not one of those quick-read-feel-good fluff filled parenting books. it is thought provoking. i would recommend this to non-religious parents as well. the biblical reference are good but most of the meat is valid even if you don't have a bible handy. my other favorites are the townsend-cloud boundries and parenting books. they are also first rate.",1,93
"excellent backpack with hidden features: when i first saw the price of this pack i was a lil disgruntled but i bit the bullet and bought it anyways. best backpack so far, plenty of room for all of my stuff whether it be for school, hiking or just biking around the city. not only does it have compartments for everything but it has some hidden extras that some of those who bought this bag may not be aware of. the waist straps can tuck in to the lil side pockets kind of like a hole that was not stitched there all the way. the other hidden gem is the chest strap has a lil whistle that can be used if your lost in the woods and people are trying to find you. it's plenty loud as well. just some additional added features that the product description does not tell you. it is also a very durable material that takes allot to tear. overall i'l glad i spent the extra money for this bag.",1,173
"this cd is awesome!!!!: for any teenage christian who likes heavy rock, fun music, and good spiritual lirics, this is a wonderful album. i recommend it to anyone who needs a bit of relief.",1,34
"good naughty fun: this book is fantastic! i couldn't put it down and when i did put it down i couldn't stop laughing about some of the situations she ""got"" herself into.great book and a totally fun read.",1,38
great curling iron !: doesn't tangle in your hair. great for fine hair. makes frizzies into soft curls. soft tips keep it from hurting your scalp. i've used this type for many years & wouldn't use any other kind. i use them until the bristles break off from daily use. please keep making them !,1,55
really cute: i bought this book because i own bad cat. i think this book is witty and funny but not quite as good as the cat one. most of the pictures did make me crack up laughing but i laughed harder and at more pictures in the cat book. i would still recommend it to anyone as it is really funny but they should definitely buy bad cat as well.,1,71
"stylish excursion into the wild: amos tutuola is one of the handful of master stylists in english of the 20th century. ``witch-herbalist of the remote town'' is a mature work. comparing it with his first published work (``palm-wine drinkard'') demonstrates that tutuola is, in fact, a stylist and not, as it once seemed possible, a naive product of an unusual and scanty education in english in nigeria. the compelling factor in his style is rhythm, presumably related to his mother tongue of yoruba. it has something of the cyclical nature of extended drumming -- it is hard to stop reading it. plot and characterization are not important in tutuola's writing. ``witch-herbalist'' is a simple story of a father's love for his child.",1,122
"i love the little thing.: i just love the innovative idea of setting 2 leds into an eyeball shape so that it can rotate in any direction while in the clamp. you can pop it out of it's ""socket"" and go looking for something under the bed, behind the computer, or in the room while your roomate is sleeping. i got one as a gift and had to search the internet high and low to find it here. i need to get a few as gifts myself.",1,87
very nice!: i tried these out the other night when making pie crust and they distributed the heat well and helped the crust lay flat. no bubbles!,1,27
works like a charm: this is our buy of the monthwe installed it in less than 10 minutes and it is super easy to program. no more hidden key to get into the house if you forget/lose your own key. shipped right away. cheap!!! we were expecting to have to pay close to 200 dollars for something that works as well as this. very happy,1,65
"my kids love this one!: my daughters were running to the mailbox every day to see if this dvd had arrived, and once we received it we were not disappointed! the interactive format is fun for those who haven't ever tried yoga as well as kids who are a little more experienced. my girls especially loved seeing other children practice the poses. the benefits of this great new dvd are that children of all ages learn how to do different yoga poses in a safe, easy format that's a ton of fun! i wholeheartedly recommend ""animal yoga for kids"" and we're anxiously awaiting the next one!",1,106
"great little tool! well built, comfy, light, powerful: similar to the panasonic/milwaukee 3.6v driver but better. it is a little bigger but not much, grips better due to the nice rubber nubs in the grip, has an led that can be turned on or off, and a nice size forward and reverse thumb switch. it has a quick release chuck that holds the bit unlike the others i mentioned, so your bits don't fall out. i own the milwaukee also, so i know of which i speak. full range clutch that can even do light drilling. comes with a nice charger and two batteries. again, beats the others in overall value and features. well built and ergonomically excellent. also comes with a nice little case, again the others don't. great deal on a great tool. you'll find yourself using this on every project that requires screws, nut drivers or small drill bits.",1,152
nice tool - good value: i have been a loyal delta tool user but after reading the reviews on the delta spindle sander i decided to take a chance on this one. it has proved to be a very handy and reliable device.,1,43
"maceo couldn't have picked a better group: i tried for weeks to find ""about time"" after i saw fff in indianapolis at the maceo/fishbone concert but to no avail. since they are local out of portland it was impossible so i came here and ordered it. with this group, funk has been revolutionized! seeing them break dance in the crowd just goes to show how many different ways white boys can truly be funky - james brown should give them props!!",1,81
"sweet bitter love: a love story of yesterday and today with a realism that few new writers can achieve, without having experienced the emotional depth themselves. even though this is a lesbian love story, it could be the life of any persons who learn to take the big step of falling ""in love"" and being able to ride the waves.",1,60
"makes a dorm room so much cooler: i got this flag to add color and more of my own personality my tiny dorm room. it's great. it is huge, very bright, and pleasant to look at. the only problem i had is not that bad, and simply corrected. it came folded up, and the creases show in the fabric. it probably just needs a good ironing. i ended up hanging it from the ceiling, between my bed and my desk to separate my sleep and study space, and it has a really cool effect on my room. i get a lot of compliments, plus it makes me feel like i'm in a fort.",1,113
"love this watch!: just got this watch an hour ago and i already love it! so functional and personally, i think it looks really cute with layering bracelets. i had a problem with the size of the band at first because it was just too long for my average sized wrist. in order to shorten it, i looked up the process on youtube. it was really simple and took me about two minutes (including video watching time). now this watch is just perfect!",1,83
my youth is all comming back to me!: doe maar was a very populair group when i was a teenager. then the group suddenly dissapeared. in 2000 they gave several concerts (reunion concerts) here in the netherlands. if you are looking back to your teenage years and want to experience the past again then you must have this album with all the numbers you can sing with and dream back to the years past!,1,74
when bad things happen to good people review: this is a great book. i gave it to some friends that were going through a tragedy. they told me that it was very helpful to them,1,35

"this is a must-have for both rock and rap fans alike: i'm not the biggest rock fan in the world but i love rap. limp bizkit makes a steady blending of rap and rock with the hardcore rock riffs and rap lyrics. my favorite song on the album is ""n 2gether now"" featuring method man from my favorite rap group the wu-tang clan. that is my favorite song but most of them are good. another song worth checking out is ""just like this"". i recomend this album to rap fans who sometimes like to bang their heads and get rowdy. i also can recomend this to any rock fan because these guys can play!",1,114
"the table: we have this table and its been great! we have it in the dinningroom beside our table...on carpet.she loves to eat at it - if shes ready to eat she goes and sits at the table...the chairs are really light wieght so she has no trouble pulling them out to sit in.the chairs are pretty sturdy to, she has me sit in them all the time and her daddy..lol - i would recommend trying it out -",1,79
"an important book for our time - a ""must read"": how often do you say the lord's prayer? how often do you think about the words? how often do you just mumble it in church, waiting for the service to be over so you can get on with your day?art simon contends that the lord's prayer gives us instructions for more than just a prayer - it gives us instructions for living. and in a clear voice, and an easy-to-read style, he maps out the meaning behind the words.i gave 20 copies of this book to friends and family this christmas. it was the most meaningful gift i could imagine. it has already opened up dialog about religion and faith with two of those people who refused to discuss their beliefs with me before.but best of all, through this book, i have learned new things about god in my life. most books put new words to concepts i already know. rediscovering the lord's prayer is opening up new ideas for me, and truly propelling me on my spiritual journey.",1,179
"super camera!!: we wanted to upgrade from our 1 mp camera and have been looking at the minolta dimage series for several months. we finally bought a kodak dx3900 and it was an awful camera! we were able to get our money back and we immediately ordered the minolta dimage s404. we got it just in time for our colorado vacation and the pictures are awesome! we now have beautiful mountain pictures that we can enlarge and print. i've already done some printing and the pictures look like 35mm photos. i have read that some people complain about having to process the pictures through special software. we tried this processing, but didn't see a difference. we have very vivid color just using our regular photo editor. it isn't time consuming to use the minolta software though. i would highly recommend this camera to anyone. it's great for point and shoot and gives you more professional settings if you want to use them. we've had great luck with the auto settings so far.",1,172
"outstanding coffee grinder: have been using this capresso grinder for about two months now, and it is an exceptional product. the features are quite good. it does require a little experimentation at first because the dial for the amount of coffee you grind is in terms of grinding seconds, not cups, and there are a number of gradations of grinding from fine to coarse that you will have to get used to. the learning curve, however, is very fast, and you can quickly determine the optimum grind for your beans. it is very quiet, and very attractive on our black granite counter.capresso 565 infinity conical burr grinder, stainless steel",1,109

"classic detroit techno/electro sound: james pennington of underground resistance fame delivers his first solo album for peacefrog, and mighty good it is too.it has all you have come to expect from pennington, the rugged electronic beats of the motor city, detroit, combined with beautiful string melodies.the emphasis is always on the more rugged side of techno/electro, but with the strings and basslines, it combines to be anything other than harsh. equally at home on the home stereo or on the dancefloor, this is in my top 3 peaecfrog releases of 2003.",1,91
"pretty good, for clip art: this book has a good selection of classic tattoo designs, and i would consider it a good value for the price. the artwork is good, not amazing, but certainly adequate. each design is offered in color and in linework. if you're looking for a good, all-purpose book of flash, and not necessarily a lot of authentic sailor jerry stuff, this book (and cd rom!) is a good choice.",1,73
sensitive and accurate: i was able to find out that i was pregnant before any of the drugstore test kits claim you can get a positive - well before a missed period. sensitive and reliable.,1,35
"a delight for those who love old books and the binder's art.: wilcox brings a grace and beauty to what could be a dry, technical subject. this is not a 'how to' book, though anyone familiar with the bookbinder's craft will gain insight into specific procedures. rather, it is the exploration of why we love books, love those who love books, and love the preservation of an ancient craft, as it is handed from master to student. as her understanding of her craft grows and deepens through her relationship with anthony, wilcox shows us her heart and gives us a glimpse into the soul of this master binder. while the subject is bookbinding, the real story is that of passion for a craft, for the unique combination of intellectual, aesthetic, and physical skills that go into any fine craft. to share that passion with another, as bill anthony did in his teaching, and as wilcox does in her book, is a very great gift, indeed.",1,165

"inner circle: this addition to the detective inspector carol ashton mysteries is one of the best. loose ends in carol's personal life come together. as always, claire mcnab weaves a tale of intrigue and suspense. i have read all of the previous books featuring the premier lesbian detective, and have never been let down! i highly recommend this book!",1,59
"do yourself a favor and buy this now!: as the mother of a 4 1/2 month old, there are not many baby products that i can say have been ""must haves"" for me so far. but this definitely is!! especially for those first few weeks, when you need to track diaper changes and feedings closely each day and are running on little to no sleep. even now that my son is on a pretty set schedule, this timer is helpful. when he starts to fuss, i can glance at the timer and see if he is actually hungry or if he's just being fussy and needs some extra tlc.this was particularly helpful to me since my son had trouble gaining weight at first and needed to be fed at least every two hours, per the doctor's orders. it was so hard to remember when his feedings started and how long it had been since the last one and which side he should be fed on next time. this product made everything so easy - just click a button, no math required!",1,181

"good, strong melodic music: ""sense and sensilibilty"" was fortunate to have patrick doyle as the composer. the songs are beautifully written, with strong tones. even if you've never seen the movie, it's easy to imagine what happens in the movie when each song plays. while this cd isn't exactly car trip music, the instrumental pieces are fabulous. there are also two songs sung by soprano jane eaglen.",1,67
like the game only better: the author manages to keep the interest alive in this fourth book. the characters all acted together very well. i especially love how the author puts you in the tyrants thoughts. very well done,1,39

"classic film.: i remember being a 7 year old kid back in 1993 and watching this movie and when your a kid who loves baseball and plays baseball with your friends this automatically becomes one of your favorites.from the cast of characters of kids who play in the sandlot, to the story of the monster dog behind the fence, to the rivarly with the well established little league team.to chewing tobacco to trying to catch the attention of a hot lifeguard and to a shy kid who is just trying to fit in.the sandlot is a classic film and 12 years later i can still watch this movie and enjoy it and remember how it was to be a kid.so if you want a great film with sentimental value and humour and especially if you have kids who love baseball purchase this!--the opinionated one has spoken",1,146
"very good product: this breadmaker was purchased to replace an old one which had simply worn out over several years of use. my wife has found it to be easy to use and very efficient in baking bread. although it took several attempts to get use to the new model, because the instructions were different from the old maker, once she became used to the new one it was as easy or easier to use than the previous model. while we could not say it is an improvement over the other brand name it most certainly is as good and easy to use. one good feature is that it bakes the bread much quicker than the previous breadmaker. it runs very quietly, much quieter than the other unit,and you hardly know it is working.the cost of this new unit was very reasonable for the work it does and we consider it a good purchase.while not having it long enough to attest to the sunbeam's longivity, so far it is operating as advertised and we are very pleased with the product.",1,180
"best of the bunch: let's get something straight right now:the intelligentsia loves empire strikes back. they say it's because empire is one of the only blockbuster movies that actually has a downer ending in which the bad guys win. they enjoy being contrarian. they're deluded.the romantics love return of the jedi. they get all teary-eyed at the funeral pyre scene when anakin skywalker appears in his non-darth vader form at the end. they are simpering sentimental fools.only degenerates love episodes i thru iii. they need counseling.the original star wars is without a doubt the best of the series. none of the other films come close. the good thing about this particular package is that disc 2 contains the actual original, not the bogus ""enhanced"" star wars with the silly new graphics, symbols in themselves of all sorts of late-life regrets and insecurities on lucas's part. no, disc 2 contains the real deal. the best of the bunch, unsullied and unsurpassed.",1,160

"very helpful book on advanced techniques in astrology: first of all, i need to forwarn you, this book is not for beginers to astrology, it assumes you're already familiar with the basics.i found this book very helpful in my studies; it was a turning point in my use of this ancient science. where basic natal astrology is useful for providing a basic pyschological profile for the client, the techniques described in this book point out how the progressions point to the evolution of the individual. it also goes into eclipses and how they describe events in the life.i would consider this book mandatory reading for anyone beyond the basics. 5+ stars for this one!",1,114

"brilliant anti-comedian: this is a great album if you are into anti-comedy, which is a form of comedy where the awkwardness, and lack of humor is actually the joke. i wouldn't consider this album to be neil hamburger's best album, but i would consider it to be a strong album and definitely worth a listen. i took one star off of this album because at a few points on the album he doesn't make any sense, and at other points he rehashes some old schticks we've all heard before. the good thing is that he does branch out on this album and performs a couple of comedy songs which are really different from the song on raw hamburger. if someone were to ask me what hamburger album to start on i would send them to 'america's funnyman' or my favorite '50 states, 50 laughs'. those two are timeless comedy classics!",1,150
"enjoyable small group swing: until i heard this cd, i never made the association of the similarities of playing and tone between pete fountain and benny goodman. i suppose this impression is further enhanced by some of the selections (""oh, lady be good"", ""avalon"", ""shine"" and ""rosetta"" for example) and the small group consisting of unidentified xylophone (reminding me of red norvo), guitar, bass and drums.except for two obvious selections , there is nothing to identify this with new orleans but this is still a very enjoyable small group swing set.",1,91

"great perspective!: i read this book through the complete works of oswald chambers. i was frustrated by several commentaries i read that had such a lifeless questionable aim, and finally landed on this book. as the previous preview stated, you get a very solid overview of the book of ecclesiastes, without a lot of chaff. while nothing is as important as relying on the holy spirit to teach and guide us through scripture, there is certainly good in council of the right kind, especially with some of the more difficult books in scripture. there are really a lot of very good and practical lessons in ecclesiastes, given by one of the wealthiest and wisest men who ever lived (solomon)...and by the way...i do believe this is a collection of solomons observations (which unfortunately many spend years arguing about rather than gleaning from his teachings)...go and learn, and see excess and the vanities of life as they really are!",1,158
"healthy approach to piano technique: as a trained dancer, pianist, and teacher i have thoroughly appreciated professor fink's complete physical approach to piano technique. i have found it congruent with physical movement principles and especially applaud his emphasis on movement originating from the torso and the use of large muscle groups in sound production. as a teacher i have found it an exceedingly helpful guide for developing within students a thoughtful awareness of how their body ""dances"" at the piano in the creation of a musically beautiful and expressive performance. this book and video promote a healthy, whole body approach that is essential to long-term physical fitness at the piano. it is thoroughly worth the time and effort to study and master the principles laid out in mastering piano technique.",1,130

"a treasure!: don't let the length of this book put you off, it is very well written and a pleasure to read. starting with the conquest of britain by julius caesar to the present (1997), this book will captivate you all along the way. my only complaint (small at that) is the fact that in the later years (1750 and beyond), the author doesn't spend as much time as in the earlier years and you don't get the same detail and feel as earlier in the book. it is hard at times to follow who's who, but the charts in the front of the book are great aides and despite the fact that chapters often jump hundreds of years, overall the book flows well. well worth your time!",1,128

"many voices: terkel's genius is in letting others speak. this book is an amalgam of his other books, all ""written"" by average americans who have had ordinary, yet unique, american experiences. it blends the best of his other works, including stories of the american workforce from ceo's to auto assembly line workers; oral histories of the depression from people who remember bread lines and hunger pangs; thoughts on the division between poor and rich from the ""haves"" and the ""have nots""; remembrances of wwii from front line soldiers and the loved ones they left behind; and reflections on racism from black, white, and mixed race people. this book makes for excellent bedtime reading, as it is separated into five to ten page vignettes. at times, it can be infuriating, at others, it can move you to tears. this is an authentic record of being american in the twentieth century, put together by a man who shows great sympathy and affection for his subjects.",1,163

"great concept, good storytelling: what a great idea -- to focus on the black valet who accompanied wilde on his great american speaking tour in the early 1880s. edwards does a passable job explicating this premise, and in the process explores race and class relationships in america, as he takes the reader on a wild ride through late 19th century america.don't buy this historical fiction if you want all wilde, all the time, the story is really about the valet, a proud, handsome, educated free black who faced withering racism as wilde's travels took them to the deep south.it's a wild road novel that would make a fine movie.",1,109
"my queen!: i just checked out from the libray and read babymouse: queen of the world! by brother-sister team jennifer l. holm and matthew holm. it's a graphic novel, something i rarely read (i've only read two true graphic novels besides this one, and several hybrids).the book was adorable, fun, and babymouse is totally my kinda gal. from her huge imagination to her love of books (and dislike of books without proper endings) to her spunk and style, she's my newest fictional pal. i can't wait to read the rest in the series.",1,93

"great music - a bit quiet perhaps: i am a die hard steamroller fan, but i am definitely partial to the high energy stuff. this album opens fabulously and then gets real quiet.i can't wait to play hallelujah on a system that has a sub-woofer. i also like fum, fum, fum; as one of the other reviews said, this reminds me of old fresh aire stuff. most of the rest, however, is very still (as in still nacht). good background music, but it doesn't move me as much.listened to the album all the way through twice now. perhaps additional tracks will grow on me (hated little drummer boy at first - now its on my favorites list).",1,117
"nice trunk: i was very impressed on how fast it was delivered, in less than a week - product was well packed.it doesn't look excatly like the picture, there are some visible ""bolts"" and the finish is alright, the bolts look ok with the style - the greatest feature is the fact it doesn't close automatically so it is safe for children, which is what i need.it's good for a kid room but i would not put this in a living room as again the finish is not great but for the price, i can't complain - overall i would recommend it for a kid room.",1,106

""ella enchanted"" is a delightful, refreshing version of cinderella. there are subtle connections to the familiar fairy tale that i find ingenious.ella is not harry. i confess that i am one of the many adults who love harry potter. however, for parents who are bothered by the some of the darker sides of harry potter, especially where their younger children are concerned, ella enchanted is much gentler. it is an excellent example of pure, enjoyable fantasy.",1,139
for my spike: my spike could not jump up on our bed so first we bought one of they advertised on tv. my grandkids thought that they could use it to and they broke it. my sister in law had one of these and her beagle used it all the time. so i decided to get one for my dog and grandkids can climb up on. this was a great investment for my house and for my dog.,1,78

pure tool: this is a great drill - screw gun. i bought it as a gift for a son in law who lives out of town so when i flew in for a visit i could help him tackle a big shelving installation using 3 inch decking screws. we used it for two days straight and i absolutely loved it. it was well balanced and powerful. it reversed direction smoothly when needed and was easy to handle.i was almost sad to leave it behind at his house but it was his birthday present after all!,1,95
"absolutely love it...: neon delivers the best abs workout and i have fun doing it. she is very graceful, perfect cueing, awesome digital effects to show you the moves and whatnot. the exercise is broken down into 3 sequences, followed by a dance sequence/routine with each. you get a cardio workout because she does not stop and talk then move but you can follow her easily because she delivers perfect cueing through oral instruction and the special effects. i think the quality of the dvd is top notch and neon is mesmerizing...i owned a lot of bellydance workout and by far this one is the best!

"read twice: this book was an excellent read. it is not a book that is easily read, or that can be read in a hurry, but rather engages the reader to think and learn each character. i really liked how different characters were introduced throughout the book, even though it was a hostage situation and all characters were present, but not acknowledged until the twist of their character came forward. this is one of the few books i will read again. i had not thought about this until reading another review where it suggested that the ending was eluded to throughout the book.it was heartbreaking and heartwarming all at the same time.",1,112

"franken exposes the bushies for what they are!: i loved this book and greatly appreciate the alternate view of things, that mr. franken posits. heaven knows that our conservative-slanted media won't do anything but stick behind the boy they allowed to quietly assume the role he was never elected for. after all, it took his brother (governor's) help and the support of his daddy-appointed, supreme court justices to sneak him into office. this administration and the fools who back it are all liars who don't follow what's really going on. great job al franken and the team from harvard! i salute you as a true american. only we true americans know what's really going on! for you bush backers, wake up from your walmart-shopping stupor! he's only using you for votes whilst he erodes our tax base and environmental and domestic policies to help out the super rich. he doesn't care about you!!!",1,153

"christmas fun from damian and family: this album makes me wish i were from a big family. of course, not all large clans have the talent and connections that this group does: this is a really fun album, featuring lots of great performances, not only by family members, but also by some of the top session musicians around, guys that have played with chicago, the stones, etc. as you would expect, the horn parts are great (very chicago-esque), but so are the strings (especially the cello), and there's an amazing vocal duet by a couple of michael's nieces who sound like a female version of simon and garfunkel. the thing i like best is that the there's a lot of variety in the production, the classics sound great, and the originals are nice too, like the excellent ""christmas time without you"", and one which sounds like it could have been a newly discovered track from a ""christmas with elvis"" session. pretty cool stuff.",1,163
"a day no pigs would die: one of robert newton peck's books, a day no pigs would die, is what i think a really good book. it is about a twelve year shaker boy who has helped a cow have her calf and is rewarded a young pig. it takes place in the 1930's when calvin coolidge was president in the town of learning, vermont.robert and his pig, pinky, are growing up together. he takes pinky to rutland fair and pinky wins best behaved pig. robert's father's cousin was their neighbor's maid. she comitted suicide. fall comes, apples are bad, and robert's father can't shoot a deer. robert's father is on the verge of dying.they try to breed pinky several times, but no babies. robert's father lives through the winter and dies in the spring. after the night they bury him, robert says goodnight to his father. erica",1,148

"not to shabby for the price!: well invicta definitely has the looks down perfectly. this watch looks exactly like the rolex submariner. that is where the similarities end however. for the price i can't really complain, however if i would have spent over $100 on this i would have been honestly let down. it feels fairly chintzy in hand, the bracelet is something like you would see from a chinese knockoff, and the bezel is not as tight as i expected it to be. but the watch has a good quality japanese movement from seiko. it works well and as i said in the beginning it looks exactly like a rolex submariner.",1,112
awesome book with great detail!!!!: it was a very exciting and was very insane at times like flying through a mcdonalds as a falcon or something like that. it made me feel like i was right into the action sort of. if you havent read it i really recomend it to be read by you peoples out there. i never cassie could do all of that by herself because i thought that she might lose it or something. it's also very neat that she saved ax because she never was familiar with the brain surgery that she had done on ax. i hope that everyone gets the chance to do that by them selves just like cass did. i also repeat it is an awesome book and got very insane sometimes.,1,131
"my thoughts: well i got this toy only few days ago,and when i saw it in the package it looked stunning.(...).but i had saved up for him.as i took him out i looked at the poitives and negitives and here they are.positives*he weighs a ton.*it feels like alot of him is diecast metal.*its verry durable.*the details on it are beauitful.*nice paint job.*verry realistic to its 1984 version./except the semi mode part.*its worth your money.negitives*i had to use a knife to get it out of the package.*the instructions on how to transform it are not that clear as how to do it.*getting the ax in his hand is verry hard.*it cant hold the guns that swell.*i couldnt get its arm perfectly in as a semi.*and the gem you put in its chest, i cant get out.overal the toy is verry good.i would recoment this to anyone who is considering this toy.its really worth your money",1,154
"thought it would be idiotic; it's not: i watched ""the strangers"" on tv, thinking it would be silly and mindless; i had other things to do. i watched and was held to the narrative, and kept thinking this is just another home-invasion, slasher film. i was wrong. director bertino put together an attractive cast, and found a sound crew of absolute perfection. this is psychological horror done quite well, without the blood and gore. it also helps that liv tyler and scott speedman handled their roles very well. it may have moved a little too slowly, and the 911 call at the beginning doesn't make sense, but it's a truly scary film. the final scene, with the jesus freak kids, was clever. not to be totally written off.",1,128
"what's not to like!: product is just as described. works great. great price too. what's not to like. pretty simple, actually. pulleys, hooks and rope. not much can go wrong.",1,30
ah to be the hero of christmas to the niece and nephew!: i got this and two other games for the kids (age 6 and 3) for christmas and they were so excited! their dad opened the boxes and they started playing each of them. this one all three of them truly enjoyed. there was a lot of very happy yet loud noises at each turn.,1,66
"great music, bad case: dashboard confessional's music is by far some of the best i've listened to. this album got me through a very rough time in my life. amazing lyrics and great musicianship. my only complaint is that the case for the cd arrived broken. not just a crack, but plain broken, as in i open the case and the entire front falls off from the back housing and cd.",1,71

"stonewall and general lee: jeff shaara's gods and generals is a very fine book. however, as has probably been said at least two hundred times in the reviews, its not at the level of his father's the killer angels. part of the problem is that jeff shaara is limited in his choices on who to develop on the union side that will bring both continuity and yet freshness to this prequel of the killer angels. hancock is the obvious choice, but the chamberlain is a mistake. it feels forced and flat. on the flip side, however, the choice of jackson is inspired and easily the best storyline in the book.despite the criticisms, still a very worthwhile book.",1,117
"minor issues: only giving this a 4 star because one of the bottles opened and spilled inside the box. wasn't packed as well as it could have been, and one of the bottles wasn't closed all the way for some reason.",1,41
"of ming and mongo: we got our first television around 1950. i was 8 years old. to me, this flash gordon serial was something fantastic. i believe it was on daily on the dumont channel. my friends and i would imagine ourselves involved in the action. what else was there? i haven't seen the series now in 50 years. from this vantage point, it really seems stilted and contrived. however, it brings back memories of a more innocent time when the video and sound effects were really thrilling and the acting just the best! i really, really hate that ming!!!",1,100
"recommendation for christmas cd/book product ""mary did you know"": this book and cd combo arrived in excellent condition. the music is a wonderful christmas tune that should be cherished by all i have purchased this twice and given them as gifts that are very well liked by the recipients. thank you j krizmary did you know?",1,56
"the results i needed!!!: this is my first review on amazon but have bought many many items. my wife is becoming a recycling guru so we started to really focusing on recycling all of our cans. before we bought this product we were sitting the cans down and just stomping on them to do it - i called it the caveman way. i purchased this product over the other ones because i did not want to mount it on the wall. it is simple to work, has a great design, and makes things so much easier. if you are looking for a can crusher that allows you to crush cans while sitting on the couch, this one will allow you to do that (don't get me wrong, i don't sit on the couch and crush cans all day long, but if i did this is your crusher).hope this review helps in your buying decision.",1,154
"read carefully.: this is a well written book. however, there is a tendency amongst students who are bogged down on reading cases to pass over this sort of material too quickly, thus getting only a shallow apprehension of the subject. the author notes how words often do double and triple duty such that ""you may want to join the bar but may be barred if you fail the bar and wind up tending bar or selling candy bars."" page 13. thus, the author points out a critical feature of legal reasoning: ""legal rules characteristically require interpretation, which is an important part of legal reasoning."" id. i recommend this book for honing those much needed skills in the practice of law and recommend that it be read slowly, not quickly. i also think a reader should consult martin p. golding's book ""legal reasoning,"" ruggero aldisert's book ""logic for lawyers,"" and stephen toulmin's book ""the uses of argument."" (toulmin shows the uniqueness of legal reasoning in contrast with nonlegal reasoning).",1,168

"here we go again! cats dominate! by moonfur: this is a great book. its like one of those books in a series that seems to stand out more than the others, and that goes for the cover too.meow!!welcome back, young traveling cats, but your duty isn't over! where's your sister, squirrelpaw, and what is thunderclan doing at sunningrocks? you five cats~but feathertail is with you in your hearts~need to warn all the clans and lead them to safety with the sign midnight predicted. you must, young cats! it is your destiny!leafpaw, what are you doing in there? will you ever be able to get out of there? i don't think i'd wanna be in there...so you better get out of there!!!that's a weird way to do a summary...oh well:)love, moonfur",1,130
"light and funny historical...: this book is not my usual read. i've lost a good bit of interest in reading historicals...but this one caught my eye because of the title. and then i read the little excerpt on the inside page and just couldn't resist.it turned out to be a good gamble. the book was light and funny and i very much enjoyed reading it. the hero was very amusing in his persuit of the heroine. his aunt, though, stole the show with her hilarious out-spoken manner. i laughed out loud whenever she was in a scene.i had one tiny little issue though. at one point in the book the hero mentions a condom and he calls it a ""condom"". wtf? while mechanical contraception did exist in the time period, they were not called condoms. this is a modern term and it was totally off for him to use it. *climbs down off soap box*",1,155
"the grand finale: as always, with evanovich, the humor is wonderful. this book isn't a ""stephanie"" but there is only one of her. i always look forward to the next read!",1,31
"somewhat disappointing. not the best book on the pacific war: another book is the much better book on the pacific war and that better book iseagle against the sun: the american war with japan, which has more recent information and a more balanced view. the rising sun oddly omits important information in a somewhat japan-centric view. considering both, i recommend ""eagle against the sun"" for a first book about the pacific war.",1,72
humanity is integ!: wowwww! i was suprising myself! i listened to the few short tracks and i was happy! it was like looking into face of satan and he looks at you and it hurt! but the good way! i feel that this album should be bought by all lovers of evil hurt core. it rocked my sock off of me!,1,61

"victories in gaul: caesar's achievement: the author had carefully traced julius caesar's war against the celts in a yearly basis.this book is a useful supplement to the book written by the protaganist himself - 'the gallic wars'. as we read through the book, we can see how caesar managed to subdue the fierce celts, and unknowingly, managed to postpone the germanic tribes invasion of gaul for the next 300 years.",1,70
"touching the minds of pioneers: read this book when it was first released and have not been able to keep it out of my mind ever since, so i just finished reading it again. as a student of history, my greatest interest is in how the people lived and felt who shaped the events we call history. james f. davis helped me to visualize how people lived and how they felt about the events they affected and that effected them. especially impressive is his understanding of the mindsets of yankees and southerners and how this evolved as the state matured and grew. i give ""frontier illinois"" my highest unqualified recommendation.",1,110
"lovely - and enjoyable for parents too: we all loved this album from the first listen and only love it more as time goes on. the collection of songs is varied, with some older and some newer, but our favorites are certainly the covers of old woody guthrie songs. using a few different languages, mitchell exposes our little one to other cultures and sounds in a very charming way. the feel is sweet and innocent without being cloying or cheesy. this is our favorite cd from one of our favorite childrens artists.",1,92
"flower power!: who doesn't like receiving flowers? this fill and spill is the perfect gift for someone with tiny green thumbs. each blossom makes its own unique sound, and the stems are sewn out of corduroy with crinkly leaves that are perfect for tiny hands. with a rattling worm, we love holding each one or poking it into the flower pot. putting the flowers in the pot is a little more advanced than in other fill and spills, put picking the flowers from the pot remains a favorite activity. everything is nicely stiched and well constructed. and unlike a real bouquet of flowers, we continue to have fun with this bunch.",1,111

"some difficult to aquire miles: great bop/hard bop collection. albums such as the classics ""cookin'"" ""steamin'"" relaxin'"" and ""workin'"" are all included. coltrane and philly joe jones really shine on these sets.even some harder to find albums appear on the first two disks of this set. ""bemsha swing"" from the modern jazz giants album is a great monk tune.highlights include the jivin' ""trane's blues,"" ""aigrin,"" ""half nelson,"" ""night in tunisia"" and ""blues by five.""not enough alternate takes for my total satisfaction, but none the less, essential music.four and 1/2 stars.",1,90
"worked like a charm: i read reviews that the cards were bogus and were already claimed by the time you get it in the mail. well, i bought mines and had the physical card delivered, rather than getting the code by email. it worked, and bam. live for a full year and at cheaper price than what microsoft charges you for. it's worth investing in amazon when you need a card. saves you about $20 each time, maybe even more.",1,80

"very good, tho brief notes, about u of i: i bought the guide for my nephew who will be entering u of i this fall (2008). i read most of it, and found it helpful, easy to read, and important in that it addressed unpleasant issues such as drugs and campus safety in a matter-of-fact way. in places, it could have offered some more detail, but the short chapters will appeal to busy students (and their parents).",1,77
"amazing seperalash!: i have used this great little lash-separation tool for 20 years. it was recommended to me by one of the most famous makeup consultants in ny and italy: pablo manzoni. it lasts for decades and is totally unique. it separates each lash and makes them look twice as thick. it works with any type of mascara. it is definitely a ""best kept secret"" of classic women.",1,68

"a must for anyone considering or already owns an iguana: this book is very readable--i have read it cover to cover twice. it is a must for anyone thinking about getting an iguana and anyone who already has one. it lets you know the committment which is required for these 'cute little lizards"" which can get up to 6 feet long. the author has done extensive research in south america, studying their native habitat. this book is known for its accurate information regarding feeding and care.",1,86
"fascinating!: renee swindle has done an excellent job capturing the personae (babysitter) of the generation x group. a generation that largely devalues the morals and behaviors that would have prevented babysister from moving in on her best friend's man.i, also, appreciated how the book did not vilify the ""man"".babysitter is a vilian that we, eventually, could relate to and actually like for her humaness and sense of humor. but mostly, babysitter was not a loser nor a victim. she was a winner who only needed to learn a few rules about how to remain a winner.i think this is a must read!",1,102
"interesting: this book involves everything one needs to know about caring for the dead in the uk. some things differ quite a bit from the way it is done in the usa. this is a technical manual, so to speak, so unless you are in the funeral industry you probably wouldn't understand most of what you are reading.",1,58
"an excellent work, invaluable to all pianists.: i studied with mr. fink throughout my high-school/college preparatory years and so experienced his technical work first-hand. after studying piano at the university level, i finally got around to picking up a copy of his book. reading through reminded me of the many exercises we went through. i think that mr. fink's suggestions on technique are of good resource for all serious pianists. as others have pointed out here, a literal interpretation of the illustrations is not the intended point. it is most useful to use the techniques illustrated as a guide and then adapt them to your own particular usage.",1,108
"best spatula ever (not just for lasagna!!): this is such a great spatula, we now own three! they work for much more than lasagna, and the handle holds up well to dishwashing and occasional resting on the rim of a hot iron skillet. i don't know what we'd do without them -- all of our other spatulas are now residing in the basement. the best thing is how well they flip 3-egg omelettes made in a small skillet or pancakes laden with fresh berries: the angle combined with the size makes for easy flipping every time. and it does lift out lasagna squares well, but we don't use it for that very often. best of all is how easy it is to clean it (i use an sos pad when it has sat with food on it and the surface still looks brand new). have fun, it's worth every penny! buy 3!",1,152
"a must read: although he spends an inordinate amount of time describing the circumstances of the french revolution, this book will reveal the pure essence of jefferson. those interested in the concept of church/ state separation or those who believe the framers saw america as a solely christian nation will be surprised at this framer`s beliefs.",1,56
good but a little darker: have enjoyed the series. this season gets a little darker and would be careful showing it to younger kids. i personally find them to be a little expensive. still a fan though.,1,37
"great book: it rounded out the series nicely and gave an insight to what has happened to the rest of the characters. in addition, it was nice to see that jason was still having problems with what happened in sherbrooke twins. in so many books, characters get over something like that in a day - one day they are having nightmares and the next night because they have fallen in love they are fine.",1,74
"great product: our baby bjorn baby carrier came in the mail yesterday. the material is durable with a lot of cushion. the carrier was very easy to strap on and adjust, and comfortable to wear. we were originally going to go with a different carrier for a little less money, but we are glad we spent the extra to go with the baby bjorn. we are very happy with the product.",1,71
"incredible book: john lewis chronicles his ascendancy from the backroads of alabama to the hallowed halls of congress - an experience which reads more like carefully contrived fiction than real life events. the struggles, the triumphs, the emotions, the meanings are all skillfully woven to create a soon-to-be american classic literary canon, depicting the civil rights movement. lewis, described as an american treasure, lives up to the title with his intimate details of the renown leaders of the movement and the not-so-well-known heroes, who fought tirelessly and courageously to end the social injustices of the segregated south. twenty-first century textbook authors would be remiss, if not negligent, by not including the perspectives of lewis' walking with the wind. amazingly, lewis remains humble, despite his successes. he is a role model, and more importantly, a 20th century american hero. walking with the wind is a must-read for all.",1,147
"if your a jeff fan ...: you should like this album...i am a big fan of jeff when he is rockin the blues...not so much his other stuff though. this album is well recorded and flows quite well, a couple of missplaced solos and almost henrix type misplay...but ifs short lived and then he gets back to what he does best...rocking out. i busted a star for the over the top solo feel on a couple songs...i like jeff when he's leading the band not drifting off from them you know...",1,91

"brilliant: ive been listening to hot water for 4 years now, and i own every song they have ever released, since push for coin. this cd is the most powerful, strong cd i have ever listened to, and listening to it has given me so much. i am not a musician, and i cant analyze this cd in that sense, but this music is so raw and amazing.. easily the best cd i have ever purchased.",1,76

"mean girls was the best film ever made and still is today since 04.: mean girls i would have to say was the best film i have ever seen. it had great acting by lindsay lohan as cady heron, rachel mcadams as regina george, and of course tina fey as sharon norbury. the other performers were great as well. the script/ dialouge was great i loved it. it was just the best film i've ever seen. if you love comedy's/romance's thoose type's of films you will defently love mean girls.",1,90
"great investment!: over the years i've gone through a few canister sets. either the glass ones got chipped and broken or the plastic ones got scratched, warped, or broken. this set is very high quality. i haven't had any problems with scratching and they're nice and heavy in weight. i've also dropped one of them before and it didn't dent or scratch the finish. they're easy to keep clean and since it's a brushed finish, they don't show finger prints or smudges. i have had these for a couple years now and they're still holding up wonderfully, and it's easy to change your decor around them since they coordinate well with most any color you put in there. they're also the perfect size, not to big and overbearing, but not so small you have to refill them often. love these!",1,140
"even better than the original: the songs on this cd are even better than the original high school musical cd. there is a wide variety of music from the dance numbers like 'i don't dance',and 'work it out', to the over-the-top songs such as sharpay's 'fabulous'. it includes some romantic songs such as 'everyday' and a song where troy realises he needs to make some changes in his life shown in the song 'bet on it'. the songs certainly tell a story and make you want to see the movie. great entertainment for kids and parents will enjoy this cd also.",1,101
"new ideas in this one from a kinder, gentiler gorrila: okay so you've read ishmael (if you haven't read it) and you're wondering if my ishmael is just the same book with a different cover. i asure you it isn't. my ishmael brings new ideas and insights to quinn's philosophy and explores possible action we can take more than ishmael ever did. one thing we have to remember is that we can't all be like alan lomaxs and expect this teaching to be with us until we die. we can't keep waiting for quinn novels to pop up like lawyers wait for grisham novels. unfortunately we don't get feed back like his students but we all have our own ""ishmael"".",1,120
"a bistro at its best: having first gotten to know the white dog cafe in my frequent meals there during college, i was delighted (understatement) to find that the restaurant had its own cookbook. the book, which is a solid thickness with plenty of recipe options, is one of my very favorites. there are items that are more complicated and others that are perfect for a backyard bbq. variety being key and inside bits of information adding to the richness of this book. for instance, in a recipe calling for fresh artichokes, the page would give you a little information on cleaning fresh artichokes. the kind of background many cooks need and most cookbooks neglect to offer. i would give this cookbook a five-star rating, but i am allergic to about 25% of its recipes so i can't say how great those are. those i've tried, however, are yummy (never any leftovers) and popular with kids and adults alike.",1,159

"the anthem for any party atmosphere: it's a crying shame that the goodmen didn't make a complete album to go along with this, because it's very evident from this song that these guys know how to create some of the most pumping, jamming party music on the planet, and the album would probably have been huge; perhaps the definitive party album of all time. ""land of haze"", the accompanying song on this ep, is a hypnotic, somewhat slower-paced instrumental. though it wasn't a hit, it's every bit as good as ""give it up"".",1,93
"adirondeck chair set: although i liked what i see regarding the whole set, i would prefer this outdoor item in teak for durability, weatherwise. they have more charm in my opinion in the teak because of the way it weathers to grey and can be left outdoors indefintely. cedar can't do that. i would be willing to invest more money to have a better product and durability. thank you",1,69
"review: gradia is a game recently ported to the playstation from the deceased sega saturn. a great game as far as rpg's are concerned. the game offers solid gameplay, a good plot, and most of all in-depth characterization. something not found in the current rpg's. although it may not offer as much ""eye candy"" as other games (like the current final fantasies) the game does go farther in terms of its plot and characterization. something that appears to have been lost with all the new playstation role-playing games. the game offers a variety of challenges, and is probably by far one of the best rpg's since final fantasy vi, chrono trigger, and the even newer xenogears.",1,116

"an intoxicating adventure: i thought this game was brilliant and played it incessantly; frequently staying up until the early hours of the morning driven by the intoxicating adventure. there's no real need for me to mention the graphic because it's all been said before but the attention to detail is such that the sun rises and sets changing the landscape hues accordingly. the levels are incredably diverse in creatures, noises, tasks etc that you can't wait to get to the next stage to experience more. another good thing about the game is that, in addition to running around overcoming monsters etc, it requires stratagy and stealth. sometimes the tasks are too much to solve and you really need to look at some gaming hints to get on. i cant wait until nintendo release another zelda game - i though it was so good. so good, in fact, that i haven't bought many more games since because i can't find one that compares.",1,162
"chamois shirt: we were happy with this shirt, it washed nicely. it was a good fit and i would buy from this place again.",1,24
"interesting suspense movie: this movie seems to have gone un-noticed by many people, but we think it is a worthy, though a little old fashioned, suspenseful entertainment. lee remick is so lovely, and rod steiger shows off his love of the stage. we give it 4 thumbs up.",1,48
"excellent! brings an earth-like touch to the story.: the dolphins of pern brings the entire pern series back around to its beginning. not only are the dolphins re-discovered, but the rest of the original landing site. it's an excellent read and is an extrememly mellow read. after i finished it, i wish i could be a dolphineer. great book.",1,59
"another savannahian's opinion: i'm so glad that i chose to read this book before reading any of the book reviews that discussed its literary prose value. i fully admit to have lived in savannah for the past ten years and probably read it for curiosity value moreso than desire to read another historical fiction. however, i had great difficulty putting this book down to work or sleep. i found the characters and plot most riveting. i found myself asking friends and co-workers that are native to savannah about the events and descriptions of the town in earlier days, only to determine the extreme accuracy of depictions. i, too, will be awaiting the sequel eagerly.",1,114

"this show is hilarious!!: i borrowed all three seasons from a friend so there was no need for me purchase the set, but if you watched the show before you will know that it was a must. this show is not for people looking for low brow jokes though it does provide it, this requires a certain level of sophistication and intelligence to be able to fully get all the jokes. definitely should still be able to enjoy it though does have its occasional slapstick stuff. must watch show.",1,89
"a wonderful book!: my two-year-old son loves this book and could read it himself the second time through. he loves to be able to say ""i read it!"" and the content is great as well. the ghosts do not bother him at all because he hs not been taught that ghosts are supposed to be scary.",1,56
"shows the criminal british as they were: if ever one needed more convincing of british atrocities and brutalities committed against those who sought freedom, look no further. as the saying goes, the british should always remember irish history, the irish should forget it. superb acting, very understated. highly recommended.",1,49
"thrilling and entertaining...: scream is a great horror movie, possibly better than psycho and halloween. the performance from the cast is sound, the plot excellent and the direction great. a movie that should not be missed by horror/suspense and general mystery fans alike. highly recommended.",1,45
"works as advertised: the sweeper works great! perfect for a dorm, small apartment, office, etcworks great, picks up lots of dust and debris. i fell in love with this thing the second i got it. so easy to use and keeps the floor clean. it's incredibly easy to empty the dust pans and not make a complete mess, and comes with a comb for the cleaning brush. i use this almost daily!the handle does have some issues but if you hit it on the ground when assembling it you shouldn't have the problem (the instructions tell you to do this). it also has problems getting around corners or up against the wall, but that is expected.",1,116
"awsome: this book is one of the best i have ever read. sure the plot is unreal. sure it isn't the best written book. but the way adams catches your imagination with his own is amazing. i can't put the other books of this series down. plus, the style of writing is quite amazing. the story is well developed for what it is. though they do some crazy things for no reason whatsoever, except that they can make a good joke about it. this book is overall awsome! it couldn't be made better. i cannot express how much i like this book with typed words. i'm not good at expressing mysdelf on a computer. i hope you buy this book and have as much fun with it as i have!",1,130
received very quick: thank you the book is in excellent condition not a mark on it/in it. it's perfectly brand new. thank you so much.,1,25
"fascinating: excellent write-up from one of the most underated masters of modern fantasy. there are serious creative limitations in translating screenplay to prose which terry brooks mostly copes with pretty well, though the characterization is a little superficial in places. i doubt this will spoil your enjoyment of the film, and if anything enhance it. i know i will enjoy comparing my imagination with george lucas's. john may (author of ""baccarat for the clueless"")",1,74

"witty but scary look at show trial phenomena: if theatre, politics, philosophy are an interest then this short novel will appeal to you. trials can be fascinating theatre and the purpose of political show trials is partly to provide some relief or satisfaction for the suffering public out for revenge. mr barnes is outstanding at getting inside the heads of the protagonists, and some of the funniest moments are the monologues of the accused petkanov. but he also provides witty asides into fashion, folklore, and history. a great read.",1,89
"wonderful holiday cd by clay aiken !: merry christmas with love is a very good holiday cd by clay aiken ! particular favorites are winter wonderland,have yourself a merry little christmas,and what are you doing new year's eve. clay fans will love this. i do.",1,45
"works great: simple concept well executed. the bag is with us on every walk and ready to use. easy, intuitive design.",1,21
"a boatload of suspects: this is a nifty book. peter gordon, sailor,sleuth, and small town lawyer is the engaging narrator of this fast paced thriller that begins on the jersey shore and never flags for a second with non-stop bi-coastal action, multiple murders, and a boatload of suspects. sure-footed dialogue and high-flying legal maneuvering in executive suites from philadelphia to la kept me guessing and intrigued right to the end. put on your docksiders and jump aboard for a great read.",1,81
"i loved this mp3 player so much, i bought it twice!: i like this mp-3 player so much, that when i lost my first one, i went out and bought the exact same mp3 player again. i love the size and appearance (very cute and small). it also offers a radio option which is a major plus for me (especially for picking up fm signals at the gym).",1,68

"outstanding movie...who knew?: if you are seeking an hour and a half of great entertainment, watch this movie. it's an intelligent, energetic, upbeat caper movie, with lots of twists. i had never heard about it, but came across it by browsing on amazon, and the online reviews convinced me to try it. the characters are appealing, the action is steady, and you never know what's coming next. even the music has a beat.hurrah for little-known canadian movies!",1,77
"a good comprehensive guide for stargate sg-1: just one thing to make note of: this book does not cover the whole series. it covers seasons 1-8 only, but not seasons 9-10, stargate sg-1:continuum, and stargate sg-1: the ark of truth.",1,40
great an practical book!: this book really does a great job describing everything its title implies. it offeres an incredible insight to chinese culture and sticks to the essentials. i highly recommend it to anyone that does business with (or will do business with) the chinese.,1,46
"just a beautiful book: i enjoyed this book tremendously. i laughed out loud, i cryed out loud. i cannot get other the fact that this is the author's first novel. it is beautifully written, a love story for all times.",1,40
"attention all people who hate this movie: read this!: after reading the customer reviews of this fantastic short film, i find it amazing that the ones who violently depise it fail to realize one simple fact:this is not a star wars parody! it is a shakespeare in love parody! okay?!?! all the star wars fans who dissed this film for making ""hackneyed star wars references"" for no reason at all do not realize that the references are not star wars references, they are references to shakespeare in love. it doesn't surprise me at all that a healthy chunk of star wars fans haven't seen or even know what shakespeare is about. i guess if a movie doesn't have action figures made from it or can't be found at one of those insipid sci-fi conventions, then it must not be worth watching, huh? let's also keep in mind these are liekly the same morons who gave good reviews to phantom menace.yikes.",1,160
"best suits my need.: initially i bought jbl e35 center speaker, it was good but too heavey to place it on a tv or it took more space on my entertainment center. this one is just the right size and weight to place it on a tv (scotch strip hold them!), voice is very clear and powerful, some time better than jbl. very glad with the purchase.",1,67
"hot value -- literally: i've owned a lot of coffeemakers, but this one is about perfect.a) the price is great, relative to similar products.b) the carafe maintains a great temperature, without any complex sealing apparatus -- to pour, you simply pour. even partially empty, the carafe maintains a satisfactorally hot temperature (if not piping, but the laws of thermodynamics are what they are)for a couple of hours. i've never tried leaving it completely full to test maximum heat retention, but i suspect it might go 3-4 hours.c) it has an automatic shutoff, a clear window to watch the reservoir fill, and an overall design that is both contemporary and compact.really, there's no reason to buy a maker with a burner anymore, no reason for burnt coffee. this is all you can ask for, really.",1,134
"norther's best: norther was at the top of their game when this album came out. the title song (death unlimited) is arguably one of their best songs. if you want a good album to introduce you to norther, let this be it. i feel they put a lot of time and emotion, force, and strength into this album. there is a slight problem, however. this album was written to a black disk (the shiny side is black), and it doesn't play in older computers or cd players. it does look cool, though.",1,92
"awesome car-top cargo bag for such a low price: i love this thing and it has saved us on a few trips where we couldn't fit everything inside the suv. in one corner the fabric is stretched so tight that it has some tiny holes, nothing a vinyl patch can't fix. other than that this deserves 5 stars, therefore 4 stars.",1,61
"the metal of my childhood: the first album i ever bought was kiss alive when i was in 6th grade and i think this manowar album was the second one. i still think its a great metal album although a bit hokey (especially the cover). the production value could be better obviously but there's a great metal spirit in most of the songs and i still listen to this one once in awhile.the biggest influence this album had on me was that i began saying death to false metal, into glory ride! all the time.its written on the album somewhere.the bottom line is that it isn't as good as iron maiden but manowar is a great epic metal band in their own right.",1,123
"i love it: i bought it as a gift for my sister because she likes this movie, and i'm looking forward to her opening it on christmas!",1,27

"loads of entertainment: my son was given this when he was 6 months old. he had already mastered his walker and hated the megasaucer. i was worried that with not liking the megasaucer, he wouldn't care for the this also limiting his movement, but he loves it! it has so many types of toys attached to it and different sound options, it's great. the tray that is removeable is actually one of his favorite parts. he takes it out every time and loves hitting it against the other parts, or just holds it in his hand as he moves around. funny how the slimpliest things are the best fun for babies.it does take up a fair amount of space, so be prepared if you're limited in that area. another reviewer said it didn't have height adjustment, it actually does have two settings. there's a clip under the material seat that will help raise the entire seat up one time.",1,159

"if you're using them for kick boxing...: these are great weights. the outside handles are extremely comfortable elastic and the weights, in my view, are not unduly wide (but i have average to large sized hands).i would, however, caution anyone planning on using these for kick boxing. the bean-bag style of these makes them very comfortable for this, but because the length is quite long, as you punch, they're going to shake a little. this will give you the feeling of some sort of a connection or oomph at the end of your punch, but you may find that you feel like you're waving a shaking instrument around or something.still recommended for kick boxing, but just contemplate whether this is a sensation you're going to like.",1,126
"miss ronning's 6th grade: i give this book four stars out of five. the book is about how rosie and her family are invited to the fair by their aunt euterpe. they arrive at the fair and their journey begins. it's a good book that is funny, always exiting, and you might learn something too. if you need a good book to read or if you like a year down yonder or a long way from chicago you'll like this book.",1,81
"excellent!! awesome!! outrageous!!: this book was a great book! i enjoyed the suspense, in which the book is filled with. it is about a guy who did something and then they did something else with another person and then it got better but one person dies so its sad, but its a good book!!! through it all...my friend had to sit here with me because i got a little scared. but, its a good book!! some parts can scare you like that one part with that one guy in that one place. but its a good book!! remember: its a good book!!",1,102
great book to teach students about the middle ages: i have taught at both the middle and high school levels and found that illuminations by jonathan hunt is a wonderful way to introduce the medieval period to young adults. this book is not just a childrens book. illuminations introduces the students to important vocabulary words relating to the middle ages in a fun and visually stimulting manner. the author takes each letter of the alphabet and associates it with something medieval. the illustrations are breathtaking and compliment the students understanding of what illuminations were all about. i highly recommend this book to young and old alike.,1,106
"incredible in all aspects: what an incredible movie. a great movie that i can't stop raving about to my friends. granted - every movie has flaws - but this movie comes darn close to flawless. in my book - it's the king of ""psychological thrillers"". once again - a must have for anyone's collection. believe the reviews - this movie is so fresh and entertaining. a twisty plot, a great cast, and a killer soundtrack make for an excellent film.hands down - 5 stars.",1,84

"worried about what your children watch???: not only does my 7 month old daughter burst with funny noises and uncontrollable desire to sway with the music, but i feel like a good parent for providing her with learning entertainment. the video discretely introduces counting (adding and subtracting teletubbies) and the use of prepositions (searching for poe). there is also an excellent use of community and fun. this is a great video and highly recommended for 5-12 months at the least.",1,80
"great for small babies but watch out for toddlers...: i purchased this for my 3 month old son and it is great for him, although he's too young to use it for teething he loves the sound the loose rings make while i shake it and he is fascinated by the colors. we'll play with this for at least 30 minutes. the problem is my 3 year old thought she'd use it for teething and with one bite dented in the wood significantly (i got it away from her before she could splinter the wood). there is also a possibility of the baby pinching his fingers in it as the colored wood parts do pull apart and i can't help but wonder just how strong the string holding them together is. the colored pieces of wood are movable and can be twisted into shapes which really interests my son- this does pose a bigger problem of being pinched but so far it hasn't been a problem yet.while is is beautiful and clearly a much better option than plastic it's not the perfect teether in my opinion.",1,186
"perfect replacement: this is an exact match for the broken switch on the driver's side door of my 2000 gmc sierra 2500. i spent about 10 minutes finding and fishing out the disconnected wire, threaded it through the hole in the side of the dashboard, plugged in this switch, stuck it into the hole and i'm back in business.i am increasingly becoming a huge fan of buying parts on amazon for my sadly aging fleet of cars, trucks, atvs, motorcycles, trailers, boats and motorhomes. i've bought many parts for my old sierra in particular. i always check amazon first since at least 8 times out of 10, i find what i'm looking for and either at the best price or an acceptable price. this allows me to keep the old toys limping along until the next thing goes wrong. also, reading the reviews invariably gives me excellent tips on what to do (and more importantly what not to do, although i never seem to learn).regards, mark",1,166
"won't know until i actually use it next summer....: you know, i think i'm going to like it just fine. it's made here in the us and it appears to be very sturdy. i won't actually use it until next summer so will have a better idea then. amazon kept pushing me for a review, so i thought i'd get it out of the way.",1,65

"i like it!: i received this cd as a gift a few years ago. unfortunately, it sat unopened for waaaaay to long. to my delight, when i did listen to it , i was wonderfully surprised. this is a cd to listen to when you are harried and headed for burn-out. it unwinds me, it clears my mind, and i can think about whatever i want to think about. it is a quiet, gentle, peacefull presentation of songs that you don't mind hearing, when they are presented in this style. i enjoy this cd long after christmas. i don't listen to any other christmas music beyond the holiday, save this album and a really great recording of the nutcracker suite.",1,120

"editing mistakes: i really enjoyed this book (like all the others of theroux that i have read) as it i could really imagine the places that he went to. theroux's insight and observations are fascinating.the only criticism i have is that we do not know how long it took him to complete his journey. or did he perhaps interrupt his travels?i also found it quite disturbing that there were a few editing mistakes: the big five does not include the giraffe but consists of the elephant, lion, leopard, buffalo and rhinoceros. a freeway in afrikaans is not a ""vryweg"" but a ""hoofweg"".he also tends to repeat himself a bit. perhaps some tighter editing in the next edition is called for.",1,120
rapidfire entrepreneurship: the bad reviewers are right about lack of depth and writing ability. read this book if you want to read a page and a half about how a bunch of well known businesses were started.,1,37

"incomparable gwen verdon!: arguably the greatest of broadway's leading ladies, verdon shines in this original cast album of the beloved and bittersweet sweet charity. one of the magical qualities of this particular musical is its ability to tell the story of the down-on-her-luck but ever optimistic taxi dance through the music. and verdon is the consummate storyteller! you can almost see her while you listen to the music... thank goodness this was recorded for posterity, because it is leaps and bounds (literally!) beyond the dismal shirley maclaine film version. a treasure!",1,91

"updated product info: i actually received *two* bags in my package! i think they've changed the fabric: the tag inside mine says ""100% polyester"" - i don't think that's the same as rip-stop nylon. the bag feels like it's made of heavy plastic. maybe they have started using cheaper fabric, and doubled how many bags you get?i agree with the other reviewers about the convenience of this tote. as long as you pay attention when you first unpack it, it's pretty easy to stash back in the bag.",1,88
"short of learning latin, greek, etc.: dear potential reader:i have nothing but praise for dr. danner's _discover it_. he has taken one of the best methods for self-help learning, the graduated inductive method, and combined it with accurate information about the origins of english words. the reader is led, step by step, into developing an ever larger and more enriched english vocabulary. i would say that anyone who works through the entire book will acquire a level of etymological knowledge and a facility with english vocabulary that normally could only be produced by a course in etymology taught at the college level. my own preference would be for students to learn the relevant languages; _semper nobis linguae addiscendae sunt_. but short of learning latin, greek, french, and german, you can do nothing better for building your english vocabulary than to buy and use danner's _discover it!_. i highly recommend it.",1,150

"a book that will change your life for better, for ever.: i have known for years that msg played a factor in my health and as such have tried to avoid it. now that i understand (with disgust) that the fda allows msg to be masked by any number of different names i am successfully avoiding a large amount of excitotoxins (aka poison) in my diet. in addition, the suggestions to help combat the effects of excitotoxins have been a life saver. i feel 100% better. for the first time in five years i had a day where i had no headache. i had almost completely forgotten what it felt like to be headache / migraine free.you have given me back my life... thank you dr. russell l. blaylock!",1,129
"a carefully written novel for perceptive readers: this book combines a number of uncommon qualities that will reward the patient reader: it is beautifully plotted, with no loose ends or errors in continuity; it is based on meticulous (but not flaunted) research into the subjects depicted; and it realistically portrays aspects of modern life that rarely draw the attention of serious novelists. here, as in his other major works, cozzens focuses on people's jobs -- how we make it through the day, dealing with the unattractive challenges life throws at us. admittedly, his outlook on many topics is old-fashioned (something he acknowledged), but he generally appears to be someone honestly trying to look at the world as objectively as he can. (if one reads his major works in chronological order, it becomes clear how this striving for objectivity enabled him to grow beyond many of the prejudices of his class.) a priceless view of one aspect of modern american life.",1,160
"crass, sick, juvenile, over the top, and: lots of other things, but the bottom line is it's funny as hell.the parady is painted with really broad strokes, so it only works occasionally. and yes, it's heavy-handed, but again, it's funny as hell. sometimes you just need to laugh without having to think about it.",1,54
"smart and gorgeous: this is really a gorgeous watch.the numbers are clear on the white base, and the stain less steel band is dual shaded, which adds to its beauty.received in very good condition.i bought it for 34 bucks from amazon.it could be worn on all kinds of occasions and officially as well, displays date too.i bought it as a gift for some one, the price is also good.",1,69
artic animal book: my 5 year old son loves this book series. the illustrations are beautiful and the repetitive text really brings home the information.,1,25
"a great introduction: gunnar karlsson's book is a great introduction to icelandic history. it is wonderful for the curious reader. however, as a scholarly work, it is lacking in precise details. in comparison to knut gjerset's history of iceland, it is an easier read but with less information. while karlsson touches upon a vareity of topics, he does not delve into them at great depth. however, this book would be great to find a topic that the reader would like to research or learn more about just because the nature of the book gives such a broad overview.",1,98
"magisterial!: i have just finished reading this book and the preceding two volumes. this is very solid work, and if you appreciate, as i do, feeling that an author has done good and careful research you will like these volumes. i have concluded that to really understand the hitler period one must learn more about the 19th century in germany. it seems to me that bismarck, by his brilliant defense of autocratic rule in germany, helped make hitler possible. the footnotes in these volumes are where they are supposed to be--at the foot of each page--but it is regrettable that there is no bibliography as such.",1,106
portable: i love the portability of this new interplak. i've been using their products for over 15 years and was able to easily take it with me on a recent trip.,1,31
"breathtaking: this cd is absolutely breathtaking! every song on here is worth mention but i don't think there is enough room here to describe each song so i'll just cover my absolute favorites. 'you raise me up"" is of course a good one. it has beautiful accompaniment and just a song to mellow out to. my absolute, absolute favorite was remember when it rained. this song honestly brought goosebumps to my skin. josh groban plays the piano in this one and it's just beautiful not to mention the lyrics are great. the first song is also pretty neat (oceana). i love the beat to it. well, these are just a few of the great things about this album. you definilty have to buy it.",1,124
modern esca: this book is very good reference for advanced esca user. many detail information had been brought up in this book. some new methods had been mentioned in the final chapter.,1,32

"poignant and captivating - ames hits dead on!: a well-written novel that spans genres. a combination of mystery, romance and human intrigue. at times it's tom clancy, minus the cloak and dagger. ames creates a motif using a palette that combines the most proper of english, a bit of slang and the right amount of juxtaposed humor. a yarn that seems unbelievable yet leaves the reader with a resounding ""what if..."" and an indelible appreciation for life's twists of fate.",1,80
"difficult to read.: an extremely sobering look at 20th century china from an inside perspective. the anguish through which the author was put through was very difficult to read. recommended to anyone, regardless of whether or not you know much about the history of china.",1,45
"the long shot: i saw this movie first on hallmark channel. i am a horse lover, and enjoy watching dressage, and jumping competition so this movie was right up my alley. it's a good family movie that brings home the theme of never give up.",1,45
"satified customer: i read the reviews on this product before making my purchase...some good, some not so good. when i first charged the battery (about 5 hours) and used the trimmer, i was disappointed. my fault. then i charged the battery overnight and used the trimmer for about 30 minutes without taking my finger off the trigger. not bad. again...my fault. then my wife used it and only pressed the trigger while she trimmed. she loves it and there were no issues with time restraints. we were able to trim out the entire area of our flower bed (about 20' by 20') with no issues at all. then i trimmed for another 20 minutes using her technique. great for trimming around pavers, walkways, and inside thick plant beds. this is a nice trimer, but the battery is definitely not a quick charge. follow the instructions and it works well.",1,149
"it works!!: i just had to come back and write a review. my second grader is struggling in school. she is about a year behind in reading. she has a lot of energy and she gets distracted very easily. i knew she wasn't in the ""medication"" catagory but finding something that might help rather it be diet, supplements, etc. i found through research that the attentive child and the carlson for kids dha was a great combination. i hit the jackpot!! within a week her teacher and reading teacher asked what has changed. they are totally thrilled with the results. i had no idea it would work. i prayed a lot too. i hope it works for your child. all kids are different and maybe have different results but it's worth it for you to give it a try. p.s. this review is my own personal opinion.",1,147
linksys wireless adapter: i bought this wireless adapter to put downstairs for my daughter's desktop computer. works like a charm. no problems with installation and setup. now she is off of my computer and using her's.,1,36
absolutely addictive: i was totally enthralled and can't wait for season four. it was historically accurate and i loved the fashions. they were so elegant. very interesting saga. well developed interesting characters.,1,32
"pilates no, the rest yes: as an instructor, jennifer has a lot of knowledge but a reserved on screen personality. the pilates section wasn't inspired, and had several variations on the complete roll up that aren't doable, and are even dangerous for a beginner. but in her defense, they describe the pilates section as intermediate/advanced.the second section though is fun. it combines a dance work out (not an aerobics work out) with weights. i used to take dance at a hanya holm style dance school, and it makes me really miss the classes i took there.the yoga section had a lot of good stretches. it seemed like what it really was though, part of a dancer's warm up. if what you want is the intense stretching yoga can provide, this is for you. but if you are looking for the deep relaxation of yoga, this section goes by far too quickly for that.",1,153
"buy this!!!: after hearing rumors on a local independent radio station i rushed out andbought this cd the same day. i am new to josh ritter but am quickly becoming a huge fan. this disk has not been taken out of the cd player since i purchased it, and several of my friends have also bought their own copy after hearing it. the range of musical styles on the cd is fantastic, you will not be sorry for giving this a try!!!",1,82
this was one book i couldn't put down: i loved the book it was really good. i couldn't put it down. ms. braun has really done a wonderful job and i have read all her books and i think this one wasn't as well written as the others but it was still very good reading and i would recommend it to anyone.,1,62
good look at ireland for the tourist: i picked this book while on a biking tour of the southwestern part of ireland. i really enjoyed the author's comments on the country. he spends most of his time in the western part of the ireland and it directly related to my trip. he is english and some of the language was a little foriegn to me (i live in the us). he has a good mix of humor and insight. well worth reading for anyone visiting or interested in this part of ireland.,1,92
"loved it, maybe because i watched it unaware of all the hype: i'm not sure how people are so disappointed with this movie. it started out silly, and the absurdity got exponentially more intense as the movie went on.yes, the acting may be off at times. the writing may be poor at times. the direction may be clunky at times. but none of this matters. if anything it enhances the ""expensive b movie"" feel.if i have one complaint about this movie, it's that it made me appreciate the potential awesomeness of a sarah palin presidency. that's scary.",1,97
this is such a fun toy!: this is such a fun toy! it ended up being my kids favorite present! it provides great excercise in the winter!,1,27
"love it!: this is my favorite scent in a long time. i get nothing but compliments from it. it actually stays on, but it isn't too strong.",1,27
"folk, country or boogie: not very often do i find a various artists cd that i like 95 percent of the songs and artists, but this one is the exception. the high points for me were hillbilly bound by rockhouse ramblers and creosote blues by cropduster. my least favorite tunes were northern lights by anna fermin's trigger gospel and flyin' shoes by solid air. not that these cuts were bad, i just felt like they didn't fit with the rest of the album. all around a great buy for the money. as chicken coupe deville puts it, ""i'm twice as bitchin' as robert mitchum"".",1,104
"better material than many costumes: sturdier material than many costumes. the jacket was a bit heavier material, which is nice, but pants were very long.",1,25
"wonderful, delightful, realistic and extremely well done! bravo!: i found myself laughing, crying, being supportive, getting angry, but the bottom line was i felt like i knew these women personally. their representation of the subject matter was spot on. i know of both gay men and women who have experienced wanting to have children and then have their partners ""adopt"" but were legally not able to. i was tremendouly impressed by the ""natural"" way all the actors represented their characters ...they were all excellent. andra and natalia shined!!! i was immediately drawn into their situation and found myself wanting to do something to change the ""system."" it's an absolutely delightful movie and i could not recommend it highly enough.",1,119
"'n sync rocks!!!: i loved this single by 'n sync... it's called ""i want you back"" they have great voices and great moves. go and get this single and their debut album...",1,32
grey's anatomy: i am very happy with the quality of the dvd's. however the dvd case was broken and whoever packed it for shipping had to have known. i do not believe this was a shipping accident.,1,37
"i love this thing!: this is a wonderful little gadget that produces a nice thick foam. it can get a little messy, as froth tends to seep out a little from the top, but a little cleanup is well worth the result!",1,42
"love them!: i got these boots for 3 reasons. 1. i am a huge wonder woman fan. 2. i wanted to dress up as wonder woman for halloween (and i did, 3. i wanted them to wear them in my wedding (and i did!) i got these boots quickly and they were in beautiful shape! the fit perfectly and it was nice to wear heels that didn't make me feet ache 20min after putting them on. i would recommend these to anyone!",1,82
"great remote.. well worth it's price: i bought this remote for $50 from here... and had it for more than a month.. i absolutely love this remote, especially for the price!i have a tv hooked up to a cable box, tivo, dvd player, xbox 360 via a onkyo 5.1 reciever and i had to use atleast 3 remotes for using any of the stuff before... this remote really saves me all the chores... now i mostly have to use 1 button ;)easy to use, does what i expected it to do.. battery that came with the remote is still going strong, so no complaints really.. but again, i wasn't expecting much :)thanks,pal :)",1,113
good bargain: well i like redbull to begin with so the price was awesome. if they could try making a low sugar one would be awesome. something without aspartame perhaps with splenda or stevia would be great to cut down on the calories.,1,43
"the funniest movie i had ever seen: such a pity it's not yet released on dvd. for amateurs of extremely intense laughing, this movie is a must have. i saw it many times and i just couldn't stop laughing at the same scenes over and over again. can't wait to have a dvd version.",1,54
"dax, bashir, o'brian on a fantastic voyage: it's the adventures through innerspace, star trek style. the makers of the series give us a new twist on a classic science fiction story. i dug it, and thought it was well done. if you remotely like star trek, you'll appreciate this. 4.5/5 stars. ~keep on trekkin'",1,54
"wonderful: this book was extremely gripping from the first. i enjoyed the characters especially lisa. she reminded me very much of myself. headstrong, willful, and a crack up. the messes she can get into is halarious. you begin to feel as if you really know the characters. the book was wonderfully detailed until the end when the ending became extremely rushed. however i would still highly recommend this book. the characters were quite memorable and i hope that she will revisit them some time in another novel.",1,87
"lots of fun, great bargain: this is a really fun game. i've been playing the gt series since its inception on the psone. i especially love the cockpit view. i think that this game appeals to a lot of people because it is easy to pick up. my ""casual gamer"" (read: almost never plays videogames) wife would even power up the ps3 to play. i recommend this game to everyone.",1,70
"a must read for those who experience a spiritual awakening.: many today are awakening spiritually, and those who have know the struggle and turmoil it involves as they shed their former concepts and beliefs and try to live in the light of their new found awareness. the messengers beautifully illustrates this point as well as letting us know that angels are truly alive and well and working in our lives. even if one does not accept the belief in reincarnation or that nick bunick is paul, the story will open up their mind to the endless possibilities of the spiritual realm; and perhaps remind us all that sometimes god does work in mysterious ways.on my 44th birthday i was awakened at 4:44 am. it happened again a few months later. i wondered why and spoke to a few friends about it. a few weeks later a friend insisted that i read the messengers now! coincidence? read the book, then you decide.",1,161
"christopher reeve: one hero that cannot be replaced......: pretty good super-hero movie, but i'm feeling nostalgic for the corny old superman movie. sure, the graphics now are 10 times better, and even superman's suit is alot sexier, but still....",1,39
acting perfection by bernal and roth: there is some fascinating musical background that eventually that brings the fantasy love affair into a real one.roth and bernal are sanguinely exotic.almodovar would have competition for the resolution of this movie.i predicted it.will you?,1,41
"crouching courtesans, hidden poignards: review attacking the film for bad acting miss the point; it's about attitude. lots of that. a bargain for the money is its supply of violence, sex, non-stop action and an obscure but cogent plot. the initial sequence, however, in retrospect made no sense as the pair attacked by the wolf men were subsequently revealed to be key figures in their group ??? almost enough nudity but the ""hero's"" modesty was a bit jarring.",1,78
"the winter solders: excellent narrative of the early days of the revolutionary war. provides a different point of view, and was interesting and not a dry ""history book"". well researched, described the personality of early leaders such as george washington.",1,40
charge batteries fast: makes battery charging quick and easy. no need to heat up the cam to charge batteries now.,1,20
lol!!: jen lancaster is one of the most hilarious chick lit authors i have come across so far. this is the first in a series of books which she has written which will keep you laughing from start to finish!,1,40
"a lively introduction to structural engineering.: far more than a textbook intro, it is a biographical narrative of the discovery of why some materials are strong, some not; how wooden airplanes were made in wwi and i, how plastics were found to be strong, or not, why fiber composites, such as fibreglass, were found to be so strong. immensely entertaining, very educational .",1,63
"a very nice book for a large paperback: the book was an exact replacement for the library book which my huskie chewed to pieces!!the book went straight to the library, so i have yet to read it!//it did come quickly and in perfect shape.",1,44
"wonderfully endearing story!: michael christie has written a wonderfully endearing story of a shy little reindeer named olive. olive is like many of us in that even though she is constantly doing her best, and getting better and stronger every day, inside she still feels like a nobody, and wonders if she would ever be chosen for such an important job as pulling santa's sleigh. this is a very uplifting story about how olive finally comes to discover her dreams at the north pole. even though this book is written on a 9-12 yr old reading level, the little ones simply love having it read to them over and over. my 2-year-old constantly wants someone to read it to her, and my 11-year-old is usually the one who does. it's the kind of book that must read every night at bedtime for months(or so your child will tell you.) this is definitely a 5 star book...a new classic in our house! you won't be disappointed with this one.",1,168
"real rock n roll mayhem!!!: this is a pretty boss platter from one of the truly great rock n roll (garage if you will) bands that the world has seen. the first side of this album is specataular, the second is solid too, although not quite as overwhelming as side 1. contains a number of true classics, incl. ""don't give it up now, which was good enough that the mighty ? and the mysterians actually covered it on a recent album!!!!",1,81
"julius baker rules!!!: i love this cd! beautiful works. julius baker plays with only fine musicians. bradley garner is no julius baker, but one of the amazon reviewers was to hard on him! its wonderful that this cd is so affordible, so many people can get to know this great flutist julius baker. one of the very best musicians ever!",1,60
"fun, fast and gets loud!: this hand held game really gets players going wild. it is a frantic paced game as you hear the beep get faster and faster and you try to have your teammates guess the word you are assigned by the game. do not try to make this into a travel game it will make the driver crazy!a great option on the game is a pass button, that way if someone doesnt know the word they can move on to another one.words include basic household objects as well as current entertainers/cartoon caracters.",1,95
"the best: can i say one of the best movies ever?! i love this movie! one of the neat things about this dvd is like almost every dvd there is a special feature where you can have commentary through out the movie, which typically would be very annoying, however..one of the people who do the commentary is seth green who is super funny and super cute! you learn alot of cool stuff about the movie like for example the school this movie takes place in is also the school they used in grease. anyways, the movie makes you laugh from beginning to end and has soo many celebrities in i dare you to count them all haha! it's a good story and even though it's a bit of a love story you never stop laughing. it always makes me feel good when i am down. this will honestly be one of your favorite movies in your collection if you get it. i promise you will be able to relate to at least one of the characters..heck i bet you pick one out for your friends also!!",1,186
"a must see for any fan of zenigata: i loved every minute of it. zenigata gets the spotlight that he deserves in this one. tokyo crisis has in my opinion the best ""guest"" character of all the specials. for non-zenigata fans there's also plenty of the other characters too, and it provides all the fast-past action you almost expect from lupin the 3rd. the music--smooth, slick and in-your-face. it even has introspective moments which you might not expect from lupin the 3rd. and of course, it's hilarious. what can i say? buy it!",1,93
good lock: just installed these on my 02 golf tdi. got a new set of wheels and wanted to make sure they stayed on the car and not on someone else's! locks look great and would be near impossible to remove without the key. much safer then the factory locks.,1,50

"his best, incredible: ""slow turning"" is easily one of my favorite cds. the whole cd is great. it fits perfectly with shawn colvin's ""fat city"" and sarah mclachlan's ""fumbling toward"" as 90's records you can never tire of, whether you're driving, working, or relaxing. although my favorite song of his, the earlier ""riding with the king"", is not on this, i still give this cd the highest praise because there are no bad tracks. a rarity.",1,76
great album: this is an album well worth the money (under $8.00 new and used for around $2.00). some albums are just worth having. this is one of them!,1,29

"a better than average tribute to a departed master: i was concerned when i first bought this album. curtis mayfield provided the soundtrack for my life. i follwed him through all the phases of his career, from his ""minstrel"" phase, through his ""civil rights"" period, his social consciouness/radical period and finally his ""love groove"" phase. all of those periods are represented here save the ""superfly"" soundtrack. why no one tackled those tunes is unknown to me, probably publishing rights squabbles.most of the works here are good if not great. highlights for me are bb king's ""the woman's got soul"", aretha's, ""the making's of you"", phil collin's haunting and soulful ""keep on trying"" and lastly stevie wonder's joyouns ""i'm the one that loves you"". no slouches on this album. from springsteen to lenny kravitz they're here and they represent. almost a ""must have"".",1,142
"review for parenting with love and logic: the authors of this book offer valuable perspectives on ways to talk to children and students regarding their choices in behavior and the consequences of decisions that are theirs to make. as parents and teachers, we often try to control the outcomes of others' choices, resulting in disappointments for us and not necessarily for the individuals who make the decisions because we try so hard to prevent those we love from ""failing."" the lessons in this book delineate boundaries for parents and teachers to follow indicating what choices are ours and what choices and resulting consequences are others' to make and accept. the principles are relevant from the preschooler to the adult, and the application of verbiage empowers the individual who understands its usage.",1,131
nice gift!: i gave this as a gift for my aunt and uncle who celebrated their 60th birthdays. they said they really loved it!,1,24

"wonderful text, magical illustrations!: i discovered this book a few years ago by accident on the bargain table of my local bookstore. what a delight! from the first page i was entranced by the concise and clever text, and the joyful, detailed illustrations. zoom, the cat who loves water (but not to drink...to drink he likes cream) endears the reader to him with his sense of wonder and adventure, and his kindness (even his politeness!). i've given this book as a gift three times since i bought myself a copy, and it's always received rave reviews. i hear it's being reprinted in 2001. now that i'll be able to find this book again, i'm planning on buying another copy just so i can have framed the illustration of zoom, leaping for joy as his raft rides the ocean waves, calling back to his new friend maria, ""more fish!"" ------- more zoom!",1,151

"excellent discovery: i just recently discovered the bodum products and have been exceedly pleased with them. i was given a set of 2 as a gift (they come in sets of 2)and have since acquired the mugs and the iced teas. i love them. the hot drinks stay hot longer, and the cold drinks stay cold longer. the only problem that i have found is that the iced teas are a bit difficult to hold because of the girth and i would not recommend them for anyone with small hands or short fingers. otherwise, i give the entire line 5 stars!",1,101

"endless forms most beautiful review: for a large part of the 20th century, zoologists thought every type of animal had a unique set of genes, the genes that made rabbits give birth to baby rabbits, or that made grasshopper eggs hatch grasshopper nymphs. instead, sean b. carroll tells us, in his charmingly offhand style, animals turn out to share great numbers of genes. in particular, we share master genes, the ones responsible for controlling embryological development. these master genes have been highly conserved for hundreds of millions of years, have passed into both great branches of animals, and have been central to the evolution of what darwin called, ""endless forms most beautiful.""",1,112

works as it should: works great. nice to have the 2 extra plug-ins for accessories. it's a little big and clumsy but that means the display is big and readable too so doesn't really bother me.,1,36
"stpepper lonely hearts club band: oldie but my 15 yr old wanted it ,,,,who knew the kids her age would go crazy for the beatles and she wanted to see this at 4.97 it was cheaper then renting or even messing with netflix.ok and i will say i enjoyed going back in time as well. the person i bought it from was great would order from him again 5 stars",1,70
almost as good as the horner special 20: i bought this recently for my 5 year old grandson he loves it. it sounds and plays like my horner special 20. i recommend it 100% for a beginner. and...the price is right as for myself i really love the suzuki bluesmaster more than my horner special 20. amazon also has a great price on it. ian chadwick's web site has lots of info on it and on many other harmonicas if you want more choices.,1,84

best medicine i could ask for: i have had a history of kidney stones and after a going through surgery once i was looking for a better more painless way of getting rid of these stones. that's when i found stonebreaker. i was about an hour away from heading to the emergency room when i decided to go get this product and give it a whirl. 20 minutes after taking this i was pain free! no joke! i have been taking it 3x a day now for the last 3 days and haven't had any more symptoms. 5 stars all day long!,1,102
wow!!: i really enjoyed reading this book!! karen hesse does a wonderful job of pulling the reader into the 1930's. her description of life in the dust bowl during the great depression allow the reader to feel all of the emotions of the characters and taste the dust during the storms. i wish that she would have provided more information at the end of the book. after experiencing all of billie's sorrows and triumphs i was disappointed to find that there was no more story to read. i would recommend this book to my friends and i'm giving my grandfather a copy to read.,1,104

"where are the oscars?: now someone tell me...why does this film get lost between the cracks and movies like the pianist and schindler's list don't? for me this movie touched upon issues i have never seen in a movie about this era. everyone should view this film. it is a beautiful well made fable with terrific acting, cinematography and a heartbreaking score by hans zimmer. one of herzog's best and most accessible films.",1,73
"another constantine classic: `freeze's over' is a great addition to any tpb collection. in this volume, you get not only the four-part title story, but also two others.""...buried"" is a single shot story, illustrated by former preacher and hellblazer artist steve dillon.""freeze's over"" centers on the legend of the `iceman', a killer reputed to have existed for over a hundred years. outside a small town bar, a man is found impaled on an icicle, and john constantine fast becomes a suspect. but when a group of strangers arrive, the true killer may be harder to identify.""lapdogs and englishmen"", featuring guest artist guy davis (of sandman mystery theatre), gives us a glimpse of john's old days as a punk rocker.overall, this book may not stack up as a great when compared to some of the other hellblazer trades, but this is still a very worthwhile book. the writing, all by brian azzarello, is snappy, and the multiple artists do nothing to distract from these stories.",1,164
"marechek is amazing!: we bought this mostly to get tom marechek to autograph it at a recent washington bayhawks game. while he's fun to watch on the dvd, he's better to watch when he's playing. young players would probably get more out of attending one of his summer camps.",1,49
"gorilla gripper is a handy tool: i have used the gorilla gripper for a couple of weeks now. it make carrying sheet goods much easier. it grips very well when used as directed. example: with a piece of sheet goods setting on the floor on the edge, place the gripper half way of the lenght, pick up as shown on the instructions and you can easly carry the piece with one hand. money well spent, especially if you are working by yourself or carrying 3/4"" sheet goods which are heavy.dlb",1,90

"good but not great: this book covers photoshop from a photographers perspective (as contrasted with an artists perspective). it contains some good sections on color correction, but falls short of being an essential photoshop book. it is very expensive, contains uninspired examples and has several minor annoyances such as sections on outdated equipment ...poorly cropped/grainy/unnecessary screenshots and somewhat questionable chapter organization and overlap. i think it is a helpful book, but is not in the same class as something like the ""photoshop wow!"" series, which is more complete and ultimately more useful.",1,92
"if you love romance and adventure this is the book for you.: leprechauns is a wonderful touching book. the characters seem so real,and each word paints a beautiful picture. mickey and princess jessica struggle to rise above their families ideas of the way they should live. their love is so powerful it makes you stop and realize that love is strong enough to survive any obstacles thrown at you. i recommend this book to anyone who believes in romance,and happy everafter.",1,81

great bbq brush: i shopped around and bought this because i wanted the brass wire bristles which don't rust. long handle and scraper edge make cleaning up easy. there are cheaper versions out there but look at the construction. this was part of a birhtday gift to my son and he loves it. he uses it all the time and is very happy with it.,1,65

"one of the great album cover photographs, wouldn't you say?: a case of seeing this striking album cover at a record show and falling in love with it. the golden color tones all over, the man sitting,hunched over, deep in thought, cigarette burning,wearing shirt, tie and slacks, somewhere in some recording studio. the name too finding equally as striking-bert kaempfert-love that name.finally, one day, i say to myself, i am going to own this. but i compromised and rather than owning the glorious full lp version, i bought the cassette tape of this. very inexpensive-a couple bucks, but sealed and new.the music is classified 'easy listening' with emphasis on lovely background singing, some bond-ian twang guitar but overall, pretty melodies played by bert's favorite solo intrument, the trumpet. reminiscent on some songs to herb alpert and the tijuanna brass material to give you a comparison. very relaxing music, soothing and with a number of upbeat and whimsical numbers",1,158
"read the preview.: i read these books when i was a child and i fell in love with them. i also read lord of the rings and loved them as well.to all the people who complain that these are knock-offs, read the pre-view. the author talks about how much he loved the lord of the rings and how he kept looking for more books like them and couldn't find any and so he decided to write these stories.it is more like a tribute and a compliment, then anything else.",1,89
"fantastic textbook: i used this book to teach myself scheme. it used to be offered at mit as 6.001 but unfortunately they removed it in favor of 6.01 python. scheme is very much the ""latin"" of programming languages: it's not extremely useful but it teaches you how to approach programming and how to think about it. highly encouraged.",1,58
"classic laymon - another brilliant novel: richard laymon is one of the most underrated writers today. his novels gives new meaning to the old cliche ""a real page turner"". if you haven't read a laymon, you're really missing out on a great literary experience. ""bite"" is pure laymon - great characters, a terrific storyline and a surprising ending. i certainly hope that the us finally discover what a great writer he is.",1,72
"helluva boy: hellboy is beautifully directed, and fantastically acted. ron perlman is the best thing to happen to comic books since stan lee. he plays hellboy like he was born to do it. selma blair is fragile and delicate just like you would expect her to be, but oh man.. don't make her mad. i think the coolest thing in this movie tho, is abe sapien. he is just awesome. hellboy is proof that the monsters aren;t always the bad guys.",1,81
"teeney tome, teeney dogs, big heart and soul: the title is all wrong: yes, these pooches are lightweights (in the sense that they weigh so very little), but canine conisueers will find sharon montrose's photos weighing in with lotsof cute, captivating charm. this slim volume features color and sepia-toned portraits of puppies snapped during the first weeks of their lives ...most keeping company with vintage or antique scales ... and all of them are simply the cat's meow! there's lola, an 8 week-old tea cup chihuahua, weighing in at 14 ounces. there' scooter and lily, a 22-pound, 6-ounce snoozing weimaraner combo whose faces might possibly send william wegman heading for a phone book. and there's lurch, a 14-pound, 8-ounce brindle dane, who, even at 8 weeks, promises to grow (and quickly) into a precious gentle giant. montrose is not only gifted behind the lens, but in front as well, since she has managed to capture the spirits and spunk of each pampered pooch.",1,163
"the test of time: this recording has been measured praised and condemned (well, no one would be foolish enough for that) over time, but is the best reflection of the power and majesty of mahler's most coherent symphony. the complaints about the sound not measuring up to the modern digital recordings reflects a need for thunder over substance and a bad stereo system. walter legge produced recordings that surpass the restrictions of his time and place and the sound on this is magnificent.and the conclusion, where scwarzkopf's voice floats over the chorus in the aufstehen is unequaled.",1,97

a must have...: i took my first managerial postition and a few months ago and was aware of an ongoing situation with a few of my co-workers who were now my responsibilty. toxic co-workers laid out a variety of disfunctional personality types but more importantly described how to deal with them in layman's terms. i can see this book as a staple for anyone in today's fast paced work environment that has to deal with a toxic co-worker! it has helped me tremendously.,1,83

"the irresistible offer and the unique sales proposition: the ""irresistible offer"" as presented in this book seems to me to be the same as the concept of a usp (unique sales proposition). his argument that the ""irresistible offer"" is somehow different from a usp to me felt kind of weak. but that said, he does a great job of describing it. this book is a good, quick read that gives you a bird's eye view of marketing terrain in a way that you may not have seen before.the sections on viral marketing seemed somewhat disjointed and out of place, though he does attempt to weave this into the main thread.though i disagree that his ""irresistible offer"" is some new and revolutionary marketing concept, i still recommend this book as it does a good job of conveying a critical idea to anyone involved in marketing or sales. it's a concept that is too often ignored to the peril of marketers everywhere.",1,160
"fun interesting story! keeps you engaged: we rented this on amazon prime last night on a whim (via our roku). what a pleasant surprise!!! the movie is well done, and the story couldn't get much more bizarre. i love how the filmmaker shows objectively both sides of the story. i don't want to ruin the plot for you, but overall this isn't your typical documentary. it's really entertaining, and miss joyce mckinney is the star :)",1,76
"well.... i liked it: i dont care what everyone else says about this book, i like it. thought it does drag on it does so in a way that build the characters for later issues in the series. so all in all it was a very good book.",1,48
"excellent: i didn't think this game would be quite the hit that it is. my first graders love it. it is always their first choice when choosing games. i like how it is versatile. we can change how we play but the first graders are still learning. this game helps with word chunks, rhyming, reading, initial sounds, long vowels, short vowels and more. i recommend to all to buy this for your beginning reader -5year old to-average 6 year old to-struggling 8 year old.",1,84
drama under the ice: actual submarine footage enhances this cold war drama. excellent acting and a great cast give credibility as well. adaptation of mc clean`s novel wasvery well done. this movie was one of howard hughes favorites.there is humor as well as plenty of surprises. i give it 5 stars!,1,51
"truly beautiful.: i bought this for ""white flag"" and got sucked in by the rest of it. this album feels much more trip-hoppy than ""no angel"", which to me had a more acoustic feel (even if it wasn't).my favourite tracks are ""white flag,"" the title track, ""sand in my shoes"" (almost a club beat on this one!), and ""see the sun"". everything else is solid as well, though - ""who makes you feel"" is the only one that drives me nuts (that sample!). these songs are meant for calm, and dido's lyrical voice definitely doesn't hurt. great writing music. :) overall an extremely solid effort.",1,105
"another solid introduction from mel bay: it's a solid introduction to the bongos and worth the few dollars that i paid. if you don't have anyone knowledgeable guiding your bongos purchase than you're better off buying this first to help you make the best decision.however:the book is tri-lingual (english, spanish, portuguese) and there's not 33 pages of information but more like 20.trevor salloum also wrote ""the bongo book"" which has more advanced information and everything in this book except for the buying recommendations and a few other minor items. i recommend buying it instead.",1,94
"good overview of the little big horn campaign: little big horn 1876: custer's last stand by peter f. panzeri is a good overview of the little big horn campaign. it is written in the traditional osprey style and in addition has excellent maps showing the troop movements.the theme of the book appears to be the multiple mistakes made by custer and his men, espically major reno, that led to the destruction of his cammand. the chief among these was over confidence. in this vien, the book is very good. this is a worthwhile read for one who wants to know the basics of an american battle where it is often times difficult to seperate fact from folklore.",1,117

mercadian masques book 1: this book has a really good plot i think the author did really good. the only bad thing about this book is that near the middle everything slows down and starts just being a regular book. the begining and end of this book are really action packed and fun to read. this book doesn't make much sense since it starts where the last book ends so i reccomend reading those first but all in all this book is great.,1,83

"great set: i upgraded from my dvd set to this one. other reviewers have gone into the details, so i won't repeat anything here, suffice to say it's a great series. i would have liked to have seen more special features for the bd release, but you can't hope for much with a defunct series 10 years after the fact. the one thing that was missing, and it's a small thing, is just an episode list somewhere. one thing i liked about the dvd release was they had the episodes listed in series order and also the dates they were aired (totally out of order). that way you could clearly see how poorly handled this series was from fox. it also let you know which episodes were on which disc. as it is with the bd release, know where does it say on any of the packaging or disc labels, which episodes are on which disc. it's a little thing, but i think it's important.",1,165
"joe ""big time"" budden: joe budden, maybe the future of commercial rap, his radio friendly single "" pump it up"" is definetly a club banger, which sparks interest in the rest of his album, but previous to his album he made a name for himself on mixtapes & was even featured in the source's microphone check. the hype around this kid is big, and he pulled through with his freshman album. its def. worth checking out, all the songs featured on the album are hot, the best song on the album in my eyes is track 11, ""calm down"".",1,99
"practical gods: i do not generally like free verse as a rule. i hoped that a pulizter prize winning collection would help me gain a better appreciation of the genre (figuring that, with a pulitzer, my appreciation would be on trial rather than the skill of the poet). i had to force myself to read the works through a couple times but after the fourth read through, i have started to favorably appreciate many of the works. i still am not devoted free verse fan, but there is no denying mr. dennis is skilled at his craft and he has me warming up to the genre. i'd purchase the book and give yourself some quiet time to ponder his work. if it takes an effort i believe it will be worth it.",1,132
