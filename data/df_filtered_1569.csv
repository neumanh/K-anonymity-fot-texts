48,"terrible!! do not buy this: i bought this for my wife for her birthday,and had toreturn it because the dvd palyer would not work. i returned it and got a repalcement, which once again the dvd player failed to work! it is a piece of junk.",0,46
59,"disappointing: the text is the same as ever (i think), but the plates are markedly inferior to all previous editions. had i known this ahead of time, i would not have purchased this volume.",0,34
86,it drew air: this book drew air pretty bad. i have no idea why someone would waste their time writing it. boy did it draw air. do not read this book.,0,31
108,"doesn't fit: i ordered this dashmat for a specific vehicle, it was not the correct mat. i returned the original one and they sent me an exact duplicate of the wrong mat. i can't seem to get the correct one and therefore it sits in a box!!!!!!",0,47
121,letters from home: i like letters from home cuz it tells a story that if you really listen you can acctually hear john michael montgomery tell his story of soldiers and all that stuffi liked it and i like punk rock and rock so it must be good if i like it,0,52
128,no technical information: this book is a great over view of the joints used in building but has no information on beam spans or loads to actually build a building,0,30
164,"great for twins: i purchased the alphabet blocks for my twin daughters. they are just over 8 months old and they love them. this product is a great learning tool for them for years to come but for now it a great teething toy!!! i would recommend this to anyone, plus i love fisher price.",0,55
181,gardening lawn book: four pages of the book was missing. it just happened to be the formulas that my husband needed. fortunately he was able to copy our friends book. but i will hesitate to buy another book like this again.,0,41
199,"don't bother: the pillow is tiny and poor quality foam, my pillow i was replacing was at least a year and a half old and it preforms better than this one did new.",0,33
206,the product i received this time is like fake one: i have been used this product for many years. but somehow the product i received this time is like fake one. it's very thin. i have to used double amount.,0,40
223,"fire truck puzzle: the fire truck puzzle arrived in the time that was stated. it is very colorful and well worth the price. the puzzle is a christmas gift for a 2 year old, so at this time i can't state how he liked it. but i am very pleased with the quality.",0,53
263,"too small: i have bought dockers for years but these are cut smaller than they usually are. even with the ""stretch"" waist band they are tight. so much for an ""extra"" inch. beware. try these in a store before you buy.",0,41
266,"cut smaller than usual: i agree, these are cut small... buy an inch or two larger than you normally do. the waist band does not stretch.",0,26
301,"ghetto foolishness: i like the hot boys and really like juvenile, but this is not good. the only thing good is ""we on fire"" and ""i need a hot girl"". just download those 2 songs onto your ipod and skip this album.",0,42
341,"bye bye mom and dad: my children and i love the little critter books. this is a great book, but it was not bound well. the book fell out of the cover within a few days of recieving it.",0,39
353,"too boring: this book had great potential that it did not live up to. i hope she goes back to writing more ""dark series"" books. this book needed more action and more editing - it was way too long for the amount of plot it had. :-(",0,47
389,"soooooooooooo not funny: this movie was not only not funny, but it was excruciatingly boring. i think adam was channeling the aristocrats. whilst aristocrats was not as funny as it thought itself to be, it was still better than this garbage.",0,41
395,"what happend sandler?: his movies seem to be going down hill. the only thing i found funny about this movie was eminem snapping in it. other then that, it is just not that funny. dont let it trick you, only see this if its free.",0,45
405,absolutely nothing funny !: this is one of the worst movies i have seen. the dialogue is awful. there is zero humor. all the characters are boring and completely humorless.what a loser movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0,33
412,"sandler's worst!: i normally love sandler's movies but this was just horrible. none of it flowed right, jokes were horrible vand stupid and just all around made no sense. don't waste your time and money on this.",0,37
441,"fraud,not as advertised: this dvd was entiled ""seventh cliburn competion, 1985"" it was not the competion program, and did not even contain the winning performance. i consider it to be a total fraud and misrepresentation.",0,35
460,"what a disappointment!: i expected better than this poorly contrived story of murder and mystery from a well-seasoned author. the plot line lacked substance and the ending was poorly executed. the only reason i continued reading the story was in hopes that it would improve as i read. boy, was i disappointed.",0,52
461,just awful: this was possibly the worst book i have ever read. i am amazed by the number of fans for this kind of rubbish.,0,25
493,"no lessons learned: this is one of the most disappointing purchases i have made on amazon.the book is one long, myopic, libertarian apology.",0,23
508,"don't be fooled by the title of this book: the only economic lessons in it are a very biased critique of any economic policy other than capitalist doctrine. i wanted to learn about economics and was so disappointed in this outdated, one-sided book.",0,43
547,this book is incomprehensible: this book was an anthology of 19 stories. i didn't like it because it was hard for me to make a mental picture in my head. i had to read almost every paragraph over. i could not comprehend at all!,0,44
559,"wasn't what i expected: i ordered the item according to the chart that was associated with the size and it ended up being to big. the item is also like it is made from rubber, but because i needed it for this weekend i don't know what i am going to do at this point.",0,55
577,incrediby difficult to put on: with the type of closures and the amount of compression it is meant to give it's really difficult to put on. you need a hand to pull it closed in order to actually be able to close each of the 20 some odd hooks.,0,49
578,"squeem: i ordered according to the size chart for my measurements and it was way to small!! very uncomfortable.i returned it,",0,21
607,"works but uncomfortable: held my tummy in when i tried it on but was way too stiff...the boning and the hooks showed through, so could not even wear it inside a tshirt. was tough to wear and i was scared of pinching myself while wearing it",0,46
610,"wasnt worth: i bought a pink rubber squeem which had a seperate cotton cloth . that worked well, but i wonder why i dint buy the same and ended up with this. this product hurts me on my left hip and i got scars on my left hip.. :(",0,49
621,"hard to put on: the shape wear is difficult to put on and you can see the seams through your clothes. it is hard to bend over, especially as a school teacher! i would definitely like to try brooke burke's belly taut instead of this old school shapewear!",0,48
626,waste of time for me: i really wanted this item to work because everybody seemed to love it. it didn't hold anything in on me and it gave me back boobs. waste of money for me.,0,36
679,meh: there was very bad effects & evil characters that look like they stepped out of the 10 dollar costume halloween shop. if you are in to paying 1.99 for really cheesy stuff this is for you. the bad guy does have a good demonic voice & some interestingly complex and incredibly vulgar sayings.,0,54
696,a waste of time: this book is not well written and leaves nothing to the imagination. if i hadn't bought it in hard cover and spent the money i would not even have finished reading it.,0,36
712,a disappointment: it is hard to believe that the same author wrote the eagle has landed and edge of danger. the writing is just plain shallow. the plot predictable. save your money for something better.,0,35
723,has no value!: if your studying herbs or medicinal plants this book should not be on your list of books to own. it is worthless! it is a pagan religion book. plain and simple! in my opinion it is for the study of witchcraft and the like.,0,47
727,"not very well written: this book was well reviewed and i was very disappointed. even if it's written for poor readers, does it have to read like dick and jane? children are young, not simple-minded. give kids real literature or they won't keep reading, they'll plug in to the media.",0,50
732,the scarlett letter: written in old english. it was very hard to read as i had to think through most sentences to figure out what was being said.,0,28
743,i've read better.: i'm a 13 year old kid and i just finished reading this book for an english class i am taking. although it was a very interesting and provkitive novel. i did not like it very much. i think it maybe that i'm still too young to throughly understand this piece of literature.,0,55
755,boring: i tred to enjoy this novel. in fact i battled through to about halfway hoping it would get better but it seemed to me a silly pretentious novel. the history of life in that era was mildly enjoyable but i applaud anyone who had enough tenacity to stay the whole journey.,0,52
769,"too hard to follow: the way the characters in this book speak makes it too dificult to follow along. i tried to follow along, but too boaring. also the book is mainly based on her thoughts. there is not a lot of human interaction with the main character.",0,48
795,"boring, very: this book may have been one of the best books of the 19th century but its language and themes don't relate to us very much any more. the scarlet letter is very boring and never seems to end. i really disliked the book.",0,45
823,received a different book: i ordered a specific isbn no. and received a different tiny book of the same with different appearence and a different isbn no.the picture seen online is not the one that i received.,0,37
831,"i read to pages of this novel and i had to stop!: i have yet to actually complete this novel. it is so dog-gone hard to understand. on top of this, i have an essay that is due: tomorrow! is there no relief?!",0,43
833,i hate this book.: this is the worst book i have ever read. the attempts at symbolism are bogged down with unnecessary detail and the language is over the top even for the time period. i hurled it across the room at one point in agitation and disgust.,0,48
862,"looooooooooooooooong.: if you can read and readily understand old-english, you *may* be able to enjoy this novel.i found it painfully long and didn't even care to finish it, which is unheard of for me!",0,34
864,"painful: this was one of the most boring books i've ever read. unfortunately i did not give up on hawthorne after reading this novel, that was a mistake. i'd pass on this one if i were you, if you must read this for school i highly suggest getting a summary online.",0,51
912,"not what we expected: the suction on this dish does not really work. the only thing i could get it to suction to was glass. we never really wanted it for the warming part, just for the suction. all in in all, we were not very satisfied with this purchase.",0,50
913,not user friendly: the dish is not easy to take apart for cleaning and i wish i could put in it the microwave.,0,23
923,...: i purchased this book and attempted to use it as a resource for a trip to cambodia in july 1999. the only current information in the entire country section was that pol pot has died. cambodia is a fascinating place to visit...too much has changed for this book to be of any use,0,54
927,"complicated: i still haven't figured out how to put this light together. when i do, the wires appear very delicate and i doubt it will even work. the directions are atrocious. but at least it doesn't require batteries, so you can feel good about not destroying the environment too much.",0,50
928,"junk: this thing is nothing but s piece of junk it came broke,didnt,work i wouldnt of rated it but i had to:[do not buy this iteam-it is nothing but a piece of junk",0,33
931,one of the worst i have ever seen: do not buy or rent this. adam sandler is officially a no talent hack. this is not for children or anyone for that matter unless lame brained scattological humor with absolutely no point is your thing.,0,44
934,"adam sandler's eight crazy nights: i thought this was a big dissapointment! it is crude beyond ""good taste."" i wish i could return the dvd but i don't have my receipt so i'll just ""trash it!""",0,36
948,ugh: the packaging was coming off the back of the package and the box it was in was distorted. i wanted to give this as a christmas present but it doesn't even look new!,0,34
988,skip it - buy the full sized version: this one makes too small and too fine a grind of pepper to be useful in cooking. you'll be cranking away on this thing for ten minutes before you get enough crushed pepper to flavor anything.,0,44
989,slow: i bought this grinder because it could be operated with one hand. however i was very disappointed in the volume of pepper it puts out per squeeze. if you are looking for a good wrist strength training exerciser this is your grinder.,0,43
1009,"itten, the elements of color: the information in this book is interesting, but the color in the color wheels and all color samples are very pale and washed off. very disappointing.if you need to use the color wheels or scales as references, this book will not be helpful.",0,48
1016,"book in great condition, but took 20 days to get it: this book was brand new when i received it. however, it did not arrive for 20 days after i ordered it.",0,32
1040,terrible dont bother: neither artist are together on this cd u get five tracks of stanley anf the rest gloria all badly re issued on cd ...please dont waste your money as i did,0,34

1266,wouldn't stay up: the band was far too thin and would roll down my leg continuously. i returned all pairs i bought for a refund. very disappointing for a jobst product.,0,31
1274,"as low quality as you can get: literally broke the first time i used them. i bought two, thinking that they were cheap and probably more prone to breaking. but i certainly didn't expect each of them to fail after one use. pathetic. don't waste your time and money on these incredibly low-quality items.",0,54
1279,why i think the book is going to be great: i think this book is really good for people who continuously tried to be one of the people out on the court.this is the perfect book to start with.,0,39
1282,"heat therapy: i used this product a couple of times and was not really impressed. to get good results i guess you would have to use it in a specific area for a good length of time, otherwise not much good.",0,41
1328,don't waste your mony: don't waste your money on these. they don't grind well at all. i just bought celtic sea salts and got rid of my table salt and was very disappointed as these just don't grind the salt or pepper. i have to go buy another set and hope they work.,0,53
1356,g.a.r.b.a.g.e...believe dat!: this is one of the worst cd's i've ever heard. this chick is garbage and so's this cd. don't waste your money on this one. chopper girl...haha....more like wack as hell girl. i didn't even wanna give you one star but i had to.,0,46

1460,castle in the attic: this book was dull non for feeling non inspiring boring made no sense. i would not recomended this book to a friend it is terrible. i rather read something else rather than this book,0,38
1482,too thin to hold weight: this product is good for child i guess..cause it is a little thin...but it is better than the one i saw on sports authority which is thiner,0,32
1490,"i've have more fun taking a dump than playing this crap: what a piece of garbage....just thinking of it is making my bowels move...again....oh god, i gotta go back on the bowl!!!! ahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0,33
1496,do not buy this game: inspite of the two patches offered by eidos the game crashed very often. lara's movements are hard to control and choppy in stairwells. you will be nothing but disappointed if you spend your hard earned money on this game.,0,44

1554,waste of money: this looked like it would be lots of fun but it's very hard and uncomfortable and doesnt vibrate very well at all. dont waste your money,0,29
1559,"a desecration: hideous. the only reason i gave it 1 star is because 0 stars isn't an option. the very idea of remixing ""strange fruit"" is tastless and disturbing.",0,29
1565,not worth the money.: when this product arrived parts were missing. when we tried to assemble it the welded joints fell apart. i wouldn't waste the money. buy another type bag holder.,0,32
1569,it is ok but not great.: the directions to put this together were unclear and failed to note that you need to use really oversized bags. after a few uses the sides have already broken. the clips are really hard to put on and off the the rack.,0,48
1575,don't waste your money: the worst item i have ever purchased it is so flimsy you can only fill it to half full putting it together nut and screws stripped out and had to go to ace hardware to buy new bolts and nuts save your money,0,47

1621,"difficult to follow: i'm a student and am taking a class using this book. i've found it very difficult to follow and short on explanations. without additional resources, i would not be able to learn the material in this book.",0,40
1641,"the characters seem unrealsitic and have a very bad attitude: i don't understand how clarence day, a good author, wrote this wretched book. a father should not be that vulgar, and shouldn't treat his wife with that much disrespect. people may find homor in it, but i did not enjoy this",0,51
1650,"a waste of money and time: i got nothing out of this book. i've read many self-help books, and this is among the worst. mcwilliams provided worn-out cliches, and the book reads slowly. if you want good selp-help books, check out denis waitley and anthony robbins.",0,46

1692,works: it was a bit confusing to assemble. had to redo a few times before i got the right rods with the right utensils. in the end you get what you paid for - bottom of the line product for cheap.,0,41
1696,broken: when the tool set arrived it was okay..smaller than i thought but mostly one of the tools was broken so it made the set not acceptable.,0,27
1698,disappointed: i was disappointed in the cd because i am a fan of the trio and this one had too much input from other musicians. i guess i was looking for unadulterated steve newcomb (sp). my error.,0,37

1723,"don't bother: this was a free kindle purchase. i guess you get what you pay for with the kindle.this was absolute drivel! this writer neither knows southerners nor humour. the story was so unbelievable, it was laughable. could not finish this pile of ...",0,44
1743,"hmmm.: well, i guess if you've never heard this kind of stuff before then it's fine, but it certainly is not the future of music. listen to papalotl instead.",0,29
1757,soothing: creates a big mess. it's also pretty small so it gets very boring after a while. i've had it for like 6 months and used it twice. and that was the first week i got it.,0,37

1784,"flimsy materials, potentially dangerous item: even though this is rated to hold up to 2000 lbs. i would not trust it to last very long. the nylon and ropes that this comes with are clearly very low quality. some of the ropes even showed signs of fraying straight out of box. cannot recommend this item.",0,55
1802,"ripped off: was very upset that this dvd did not specify that you could not play it in the united states. why was it on amazon, usa. false will not deal with this vendor ever again and will make sure my friends and colleagues are aware of it..",0,48
1820,not what i expected: being a wolverine fan ; this is nothing like i expected. really don't like the drawing or storyline. looks fake.,0,24
1842,"my bad, but theirs too: it did not even occur to me that a plug-in co detector would not have battery back-up, which is my fault for missing that. however, what the?? i mean, they all should have batter back-up. this one has to go back.",0,46
1864,"journal making?: i bought this book wanting to learn how to make a journal. this book did not show the basics. it was a waste of money, the author seemed more interested in presenting cute ideas and making pretty pictures than teaching basics.",0,43
1868,"not my type of book: i just couldn't get into this book. right from the start, it seemed like the author was trying to hide something from the reader and that annoyed me. also, it contained too many long descriptions. not my type of book.",0,45
1884,disappointed: don't waste your money the pump to pressurize the rocket broke after first and only use. very disappointed bought this for my brothers children because he used to have one as a kid and he loved it so i bought this one and it broke on the first try.,0,50

1905,"come on.............: we know back in black was one of the best albums in history...do we really need some ""experts"" to tell us this ??i'm a big ac/dc fan i would not buy this....",0,34
1945,printing is way too small!: book is over 600 pages and the print is so small it was difficult for me to try to read so i returned it. perhaps if it ever comes out on kindle i would try again.,0,41
1957,"not very good: i don't remember this movie, so i know it was bad. i probably did not watch the whole thing. bad production, bad acting",0,26
1967,"not too durable.: this was great as a halloween costume. however, after my daughter tried it on, one of the straps on the leg covers broke and the mask was too tight. good for a one time use. my daughter enjoyed it.",0,42
1974,"expect what you pay for: the price was cheap and so was a majority of the craftsmanship. also, the belt was not in the package and we bought it new.",0,30

1995,"too small for a shower curtain: this rod is way to small for use with a shower curtain. i have no idea why it even comes up in the search. it may work for a simple curtain, but i doubt it.",0,41

4227,ouch!: the ears on the rabbit are sharp and the first time i used it i felt like it cut me after wards. if the ears weren't so sharp this toy would be higher on my list of favorites.,0,39
4230,"the worst ever: this is one of the worst one i ever bought. the price is kind of high so i expected it to have some use. there is no vibrating motion beside the rabbit head. since this product can not be return, i used it once and went righ in the trash.",0,53
4235,"not waterproof!: this thing is awful! the first time i used it water it filled up with water and shorted out. i've dried it, replaced the batteries and it still won't work. i only used it 2 times. this is a total waste of money!",0,45

4261,"don't be fooled this is just a documental: no one song complete, just short clips and explanations about the making of the album, nice but not for a dvd, at least in my humble opinion.",0,35
4262,"buy something else: the dvd is a documentory, alot of talking and very little music. i thought it was them in concert. too much talking",0,25
4288,"not what you think....: this item is not what you think it is. this video is only about the war, not on what horrors were done to the people in the camps. except for history buffs and teachers, this would not be a good video just for viewing pleasure.",0,49
4322,too small: hard to tell from the picture what size this is. i thought it was much larger. it would not hold much more than a 1/2 pound of coffee. too much space is wasted for the filter holder section.,0,40
4347,a toy not made to last: this toy has peaces that fall off even while puting it together it kept falling apart the legs would not stay on and part of the tower would not stay together. i would not recomend this toy to anyone else or pay for it again myself.,0,52

4367,"a little disappointing: i loved all of sophie kinsella's books. this book is definitely not as good as the shopaholic series. the characters aren't really well-defined, the plot meanders at the end. you can avoid this book and not miss much.",0,41
4384,disappointed: i bought this for the kindle and there is none of the modern text translation referred to by the other reviews. i am very disappointed because that is the only reason i purchased this book. they should not use printed version reviews for kindle books.,0,46
4397,"not new as stated: this product was shipped to me in a reasonable time, but the description said it was new when it had been annotated and highlighted throughout the book. i was disappointed with this since i wanted a new version of this book.",0,45

4409,"does not match picture.: the picture for this item showed the lines to be numbered. when we received it, it was not numbered. this is needed for a class assignment and we had to go elsewhere to purchase what amazon did not provide.",0,43
4423,"getting old: this may be one of the great works of humanity, but it just doesn't cut it for me. the gender sterotypes are nauseating, to say the least. though required in schools, this book is nnot one of the bests to read on your own time. or maybe i am just disillussioned.",0,53

4477,"had to buy this for a class-- not very informative: the chapters are set up like a pamplet with bulleted information. it just doesn't seem appropriate for a college class. it is written like a middle school textbook, and it doesn't offer more information than what most laymen already know.",0,50
4490,"i don't believe manson had anything to do with this.: ok, if your a manson collector of course you have to have this, but otherwise it is not even a good read, let alone manson's words.buy it if you are collecting, but read helter skelter or the family for a better read.",0,52

4569,art of dali: i liked the book. the mix of explanations of the painting and his life was very descriptive. i learned a lot about his friends and famliy. the book just reminds me that in every genius there's a lunatic.,0,41
4584,"just ok...: i have had these for a little over a year now. the edges are starting to chip off, and they have been stained a little. they are ok, but not wonderful. i feel like for a kitchen aid product, they should be much better.",0,46
4587,"cool, but not durable: my little brother just got this for his birthday. it's cool, but will probably be broken in a few days. the pieces that stick to the wall fall off alot. no action figures come with it either. and the bottom half is made of cardboard too--not cool.",0,51
4589,falls apart very easily: i bought this for my 6 year old son and it is very unstable. it falls apart way to easily. we have to lean it up against the wall so he can play with it and it still falls down.,0,44

4660,bad quality: installation and use was easy and good. but the quality of the product was really bad and it was going loose and stopped working in between.,0,28
4665,not enough choices: there are not enough color selections for the average person. the product seems to work but coverblend needs to work on offering more color selections as women come in a variety of shades and skin tones.,0,39
4676,"couldn't get into it.: i'd heard such good things about this book, and couldn't wait to read it. unfortunately, i found it really slow. i read the paperback version, and to be honest, i couldn't bring myself to finish the book. major disappointment.",0,43

4705,"amazon needs to sort out weinstock and huneker: this book is listed with weinstock as the author, but huneker is the author. weinstock wrote the forward. he also wrote a book called ""chopin: the man and his music"". weinstock should not even be listed as a secondary author, much less the primary author.",0,53

4806,"not worth your money: they should have called this product lemon vaseline. the scent is nice, but it almost isn't a scrub at all; it's got some granulated sugar among a sea of greasy pommade. it leaves skin sticky and does not wash off. do not buy this product if you're expecting an actual exfoliator!",0,55
4830,cd was missing: i dont find any cd inside the book. it was really matter of disgrace that cd was missing after shifting. while i was going for the purchase it was mentioned that the cd will be available but it was missing,0,43

4978,semi- additive cooking: very disappointing the recipes are filled with unhealthy ingredients .the concept is great but the nutritional benefits are not there-- so it isnt a quick fix for me.hard to imagine wolfgang endorsing such a book,0,38

5109,"not for my application: i was misled by a user review that indicated the gels would help my new jawbone stay in my ear without the hook. the gels would stay in my ear but came off my headset, allowing it to fall to the ground. these may be ok but not for my application.",0,55
